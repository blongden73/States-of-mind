Form: "A step by step guide to processing strong emotions. \n \nStep 1: Find a place
  where you feel most comfortable, you may like to find a pillow or a blanket and
  place this against your chest. \n\nStep 2: Move your attention to your body and
  begin to notice how your body feels, practicing the skills you have developed earlier
  in the module. Observe what parts of your body are holding the emotion you are feeling
  and focus in on these areas. \n\nStep 3: Imagine the emotion you are feeling is
  a small balloon. Now using your awareness, expand the emotion, as if it was a balloon,
  by using your breathing. Allow the emotion to get bigger and bigger until your body
  and the emotion feels expanded by your breathing. \n\nStep 4: Aim to create as much
  space for the feeling to grow and use your breathing to release the emotion by taking
  longer, deep breaths out. You can visualise the balloon deflating with each breath
  you take and the balloon getting bigger every time you breathe air into your body.
  \n\nStep 5: Keep using your breath to breathe in and out until you feel you have
  released the emotion from your body by inflating and deflating your emotional balloon
  enough times. \n\nStep 6: When your body feels calmer, make some notes on how the
  emotion felt in your body so that you can recognise it the next time you feel it.
  This will help you describe your emotional experience to others the next time you
  feel you would like to.\n\n\n"
