Form: "Find a place on your body that feels more sensitive or uncomfortable. \n\nCommon
  places that people choose are their chest, stomach or both. \n\nPlace your hand
  on whatever part of your body intuitively feels right and notice how your body responds
  to this touch. \n\nYou can adapt the pressure or motion of your hand based on what
  feels most comfortable and soothing for this part of your body. \n\nSoothing touch
  helps calm the stress response and return your body to a feeling of safety. \n\nYou
  can extend this practice by experimenting with touch in different parts of your
  body and becoming familiar with what types of touch allow you to feel most relaxed
  and at ease. \n\nThis can be combined with a breathing practice to help calm the
  nervous system and return us to a feeling of internal safety. \n"
