Find a place on your body that feels more sensitive or uncomfortable. Common places that people choose are their chest, stomach or both. 

Place your hand on whatever part of your body intuitively feels right and notice how your body responds to this touch. 

You can adapt the pressure or motion of your hand based on what feels most comfortable and soothing for this part of your body. Soothing touch helps calm the stress response and return your body to a feeling of safety. 

You can extend this practice by experimenting with touch in different parts of your body and becoming familiar with what types of touch allow you to feel most relaxed and at ease. 

This can be combined with a breathing practice to help calm the nervous system and return us to a feeling of internal safety.
