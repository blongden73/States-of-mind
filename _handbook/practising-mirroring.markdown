  The key to mirroring is reflecting back what you see, feel and notice in the other person.
  Read the instructions before beginning the activity.
  In pairs, choose who will be the speaker and who will be ‘the mirror’. When you are ready, set a timer for 2 minutes. You can do the activity with more time after practising it once.
  Ask the person to tell a story for 2 minutes about something that they enjoy doing.
  As you listen to the story, notice how the person tells the story, through their words, emotional expressions and body language.
  When the person has finished their story, thank them and begin to reflect back:
  What you heard them say.
  What you noticed emotionally in yourself when you heard the story
  What you noticed in their body language
  What you noticed in their emotional expression as they told their story
  Allow the speaker to take a few minutes to make some notes with the following prompts:

  <form id="test-form">
    <div>
      <label>What did it feel like to have your story reflected back to you?</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="mirroring_a" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>What was it like to have the emotional aspect of the story reflected back to you? Was it accurate?</label>

      </div>
      <div>
