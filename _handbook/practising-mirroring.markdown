The key to mirroring is reflecting back what you see, feel and notice in the other person. 

Read the instructions before beginning the activity. 

In pairs, choose who will be the speaker and who will be ‘the mirror’. When you are ready, set a timer for 2 minutes. You can do the activity with more time after practising it once. 

1. Ask the person to tell a story for 2 minutes about something that they enjoy doing. 
2. As you listen to the story, notice how the person tells the story, through their words, emotional expressions and body language. 
3. When the person has finished their story, thank them and begin to reflect back: 

What you heard them say. 

What you noticed emotionally in yourself when you heard the story

What you noticed in their body language 

What you noticed in their emotional expression as they told their story 

Allow the speaker to take a few minutes to make some notes with the following prompts: 

Question:

What did it feel like to have your story reflected back to you?

Question:

What was it like to have the emotional aspect of the story reflected back to you? Was it accurate?  

Question:

How did it feel to have somebody reflect back your body language to you? 

Question:

How did the listener feeding this information back to you make you feel about the experience that you shared? 


Swap and repeat the activity, this time, the speaker acting as the mirror.

When both people have completed the activity and taken notes, ask the pairs to feedback to the group:What was it like to feedback this information to somebody? What was it like to have this information fed back to you? 

Question:

How did this type of speaking and listening compare to other times you have shared your story with somebody?
