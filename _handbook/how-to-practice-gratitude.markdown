  Exercise.

  Reflect on the times when you have felt the need to get something, do something or change something to make yourself feel better in the present moment.

  Q. What was the emotion that you felt when you felt this need?

  A.

  Q. What beliefs did you notice yourself having in this moment?

  A.

  Q. What mindsets did you have about your self-image and self-worth?

  A.

  Now, bring awareness to the present moment. Consider the aspects of your life that provide you with a sense of reassurance and comfort. This may be having a friend to talk to when you are bored, your ability to have access to the information you find interesting, the park nearby or simply the feeling of being comfortable and safe when you go to bed at night.

  The trick with practising gratitude is to notice the simple things and the small things in our lives and begin to notice what it is about these things that you appreciate and acknowledge. It allows you to reflect on the resources you already have and to recognise the meaning that exists in them.

  Q. What parts of your life are you grateful for? What situation and circumstances bring you a sense of relief and reassurance?

  A.

  Q. What resources are available to you? How do these resources help you to do things you enjoy?

  A.

  Q. What qualities exist in the people you spend time with that you appreciate and are thankful for? Think of a person and make a note about the qualities they have that you most admire.

  A.

  Q. Consider your own qualities, skills and attributes. What parts of yourself do you think other people appreciate and find value in?

  A.

  Why does this practice help me to feel better?

  By practising gratitude it reduces stress and tension that is caused by the feeling of needing to have more or do more to be able to feel safe and well. Often those things that make us feel safe and well are already with us, but we forget to notice and acknowledge them if we are in a state of fear.

  Gratitude is an attitude that we can bring to our lives, that allows us to slow down from the pace of fear and really notice the things in our lives that have meaning for us. Meaning provides us with a sense of fulfilment, which calms our nervous systems and allows us to experience a sense of calm, stillness and wellbeing.

  What does research tell us about the importance of gratitude?

  Research shows that when we bring conscious awareness to the things we are grateful for, we experience benefits in our mind, body, emotions and relationships.

  List of benefits:

  Gratitude is a ‘social glue’. Practising gratitude reinforces the positive feelings in our relationships and strengthens the bonds between us.

  Gratitude helps to alleviate a range of uncomfortable emotions such as envy, resentment, frustration and regret. Robert A. Emmons, a gratitude researcher has found that practising gratitude increases happiness and reduces depression.

  Gratitude improves our self-esteem.

  Anxiety, depression and uncomfortable emotions are strongly linked to our sense of social inequality and the frequency with which we compare ourselves to others. When we practice gratitude it moves our attention away from our negative attitudes towards others and allows us to develop a healthier attitude in our relationships to others.

  Grateful people sleep better.

  Reflecting on what we are grateful for reduces our stress response and provides us with a tool to self-soothe. When we practice gratitude before sleeping, research has shown that we experience a better quality of sleep and reduced anxiety when we wake up.

“Gratitude has been conceptualized as an emotion, a virtue, a moral sentiment, a motive, a coping response, a skill, and an attitude. It is all of these and more,”

\(Emmons & Crumpler, 2000)

\*\*What is gratitude? \*\*

Gratitude is the ability to pay attention to the aspects of our lives and the people around us, that bring us joy, happiness and a sense of humility. When we become distracted and preoccupied with life’s many demands it’s easy to forget to take time to appreciate all those things in our environment that nurture us and bring us a sense of wellbeing.

Gratitude is closely connected to our ability to pay attention and consciously reflect on the things we have that are important to us. These may be small moments we have enjoyed that we are grateful to have experienced, belongings that remind us of important times in our lives or the people in our life who make us feel supported and cared for.

When we bring attention to these things, it allows us to move from a mindset of scarcity and lack, to a mindset of appreciation for all that we have.

\*\*Healing our Scarcity Mindset \*\*

When we are in a scarcity mindset and focus on all the things we don’t have that others do, we feel fear and inadequacy and often become unable to notice and recognise the value and meaning that already exists in our lives. When we bring an attitude of appreciation, it allows us to see those parts of our lives we have neglected and not paid attention to in our busyness.  It helps us to stop comparing ourselves to others and can help us to restore our self-esteem.
