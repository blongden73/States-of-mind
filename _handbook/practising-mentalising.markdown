The most important aspect of mentalizing is being genuinely curious about another person's experience.  It is important that you do not pretend to act curious or it will not truly be mentalizing. 

Think of a scenario that currently exists in your life, where a friend, family member or somebody else that you know is acting in a way that is causing you frustration or a sense of disconnection. 

Start by writing down your assumptions about the scenario. How has it made you feel and what assumptions have you automatically made about why they are acting this way? This will help you mentalise yourself and bring awareness to the nature of your own feelings and reactions. 

Now, bringing an empathetic and curious stance when considering the situation, consider the following questions?

Q. What might be causing them to act like this?

A.

Q. What might be going on in their life that I am not aware of?

A.

Q. What would cause somebody to behave in this way? 

A.

Q. What else might this person be thinking and feeling that I have not considered?

A.
