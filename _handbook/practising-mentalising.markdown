      Now, bringing an empathetic and curious stance when considering the situation, consider the following questions.

    <div>
      <label>Consider other times in your life when you noticed that you were not really mentalising but mind reading. Think about what was happening in the situation.

    </div>
    <div>
      <label>What assumptions did you make about the person you were 'mindreading'?
  </label>
      <textarea type="text" name="mentalis_j" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>How might the situation have been different if you had brought a mentalising stance to the situation and communicated your uncertainty to the other person?

    Remember, our mentalising capacity turns off when we are feeling stressed, anxious or experiencing difficult emotions, so don’t worry - it’s normal for this to happen. The important thing is to bring awareness to this process so that we can change our responses and reactions to misunderstandings that happen as a result of mindreading.
    The more we are able to practice mentalising, the more we will experience empathy and a sense of connection in our relationships.  Our ability to mentalise is connected with our ability to connect with and become attuned to the experience of other people, while at the same time recognising that each person has their own unique way of experiencing something.

Think of a scenario that currently exists in your life, where a friend, family member or somebody else that you know is acting in a way that is causing you frustration or a sense of disconnection. 

Think about how has it made you feel and what assumptions you have automatically made about why they are acting this way. 

This will help you mentalise yourself and bring awareness to the nature of your own feelings and reactions.
