Form: "\nStep 1.\n\nFind a place where you can relax and be undisturbed while you
  complete the practice.\nWith a piece of paper and a pen, write at the top of the
  page ‘Who am I?’. \n\nTake time to write down the associations that come to mind
  as you consider this question. \n\nAllow the answers to emerge freely and honestly.
  Take time to pause and consider the question and connect with as many associations
  as you can.\n\nWhen you feel you have completed the list, label each answer from
  a scale of 1-10 based on how you connected you feel with this part of your identity
  or personality, with 10 being the strongest connection and 1 being the least strong.\n\nMake
  some notes to the following questions:\n<form id=\"test-form\">\n  <div>\n    <label>When
  can you remember first associating with this part of your identity?</label>\n    <textarea
  type=\"text\" name=\"who_am_i_a\" placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"/></textarea>\n
  \ </div>\n  <div>\n    <label>What informed this part of your identity?</label>\n
  \   <textarea type=\"text\" name=\"who_am_i_b\" placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"/></textarea>\n
  \ </div>\n  <div>\n    <label>How does associating with this part of you serve you
  in your life?</label>\n    <textarea type=\"text\" name=\"who_am_i_c\" placeholder=\"Type
  your answer here\"/></textarea>\n  </div>\n<div>\n    <label>How does associating
  with this part of you limit you?</label>\n    <textarea type=\"text\" name=\"who_am_i_d\"
  placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"/></textarea>\n  </div>\n<div>\n    <label>What
  is your username?</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Type
  your answer here\"/></input>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <button type=\"submit\"id=\"submit-form\">Submit</button>\n
  \ </div>\n</form>\n\n**Step 2: **\nTake some time to breathe deeply and find a comfortable
  position. When you are ready, close your eyes and consider the question again. Allow
  an image to emerge in your mind in response to the question. Do not try to create
  an image for yourself but relax and allow it to emerge. When you have connected
  with this image, open your eyes and make notes about what you saw and the meaning
  that it had for you. How did you feel as you connected with this image? What was
  this image showing you?\n\nIt is recommended that you continue to do this exercise
  over a period of time. Its impact deepens with repeated use.\n\nFor use with two
  people / in groups.\n\nFind a private space, with enough distance from others so
  that you feel comfortable to reflect in an honest way about yourself.\n\nWrite down
  a list of the aspects of your identity that you feel most accurately represent you,
  using the opening prompt ‘I am…’\n\nFind a partner and swap your list with them.
  It is really important here to not rush this exercise but take time to gently and
  kindly feedback each point on the list, by swapping the statements from ‘I am’ to
  ‘You are’.\n\nVery slowly and mindfully, aware of how this activity may evoke emotions
  in the other, read each aspect of their identity back to them, beginning the sentence
  with ‘You are’ instead of ‘I am’.\n\nAfter each aspect is read out, take a moment
  to pause and allow the person to receive the statement. As each is read out, invite
  the listener to notice the feelings and sensations that the activity invokes in
  them.\n\nContinue with this process, until you reach the end of the list, at which
  point the listener can take a few minutes to make some notes about their experience
  of the exercise.\n\nInvite the listener to take a couple of minutes to take notes
  on what the experience was like for them.\n\nSwap and repeat the exercise.\n\n**Useful
  prompts for the reflection: **\n\nWhat feelings did you notice came up as you listened
  back to the different aspects of your identity?\n\nWhich aspects of your identity
  did you feel most connected to?\n\nWhich aspects of your identity did you feel most
  resistant to?\n\nMake a note of anything else that you noticed that felt significant
  to you.\n\nIf you are doing this activity with another person, Invite the listener
  to swap roles with the reader and repeat the exercise again.\n\nGroup Discussion:\n\nAfter
  both people in the pair have completed the exercise, invite them to share their
  experiences with each other for 5 minutes.\n\nWhen the pairs have finished their
  discussion, invite them to feedback something from their discussions to the whole
  group.\n\nUseful prompts for the discussion:\n\nWhat has this activity taught you
  about how you see yourself?\n\nWhat has this activity taught you about what identity
  means?"
