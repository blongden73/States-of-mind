  The purpose of this practice is to help you develop self-awareness and connect more closely with the qualities of your true self. Each of us have many layers of our identity that we associate with, these parts of our personality that we identify with may be experienced as positive or negative. Some of these aspects of our identity may be like a mask, helping us to hide parts of ourselves that we do not like, whereas others may be positive aspects of ourselves that we do not acknowledge or accept. Beneath each of these layers is an inner core, or centre of identity called the Self, which is a loving and creative centre that represents our true self, the essence of who we are.

  Procedure

  Step 1.
  Find a place where you can relax and be undisturbed while you complete the practice.
  With a piece of paper and a pen, write at the top of the page ‘Who am I?’. Take time to write down the associations that come to mind as you consider this question. Allow the answers to emerge freely and honestly. Take time to pause and consider the question to connect with as many associations as you can.

  When you feel you have completed the list, label each answer from a scale of 1-10 based on how you connected you feel with this part of your identity or personality, with 10 being the strongest connection and 1 being the least strong.

  Make some notes to the following questions:
  <form id="test-form">
    <div>
      <label>When can you remember first associating with this part of your identity?</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="mindset_serve_you" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>What informed this part of your identity?</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="mindset_limit_you" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>How does associating with this part of you serve you in your life?</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="detach_mindset" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
  <div>
      <label>How does associating with this part of you limit you?</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="detach_mindset" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
  <div>
      <label>What is your username?</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></input>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit"id="submit-form">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </form>

  **Step 2: **
  Take some time to breathe deeply and find a comfortable position. When you are ready, close your eyes and consider the question again. Allow an image to emerge in your mind in response to the question. Do not try to create an image for yourself but relax and allow it to emerge. When you have connected with this image, open your eyes and make notes about what you saw and the meaning that it had for you. How did you feel as you connected with this image? What was this image showing you?

  It is recommended that you continue to do this exercise over a period of time. Its impact deepens with repeated use.

  For use with two people / in groups.

  Find a private space, with enough distance from others so that you feel comfortable to reflect in an honest way about yourself.

  Write down a list of the aspects of your identity that you feel most accurately represent you, using the opening prompt ‘I am…’

  Find a partner and swap your list with them. It is really important here to not rush this exercise but take time to gently and kindly feedback each point on the list, by swapping the statements from ‘I am’ to ‘You are’.

  Very slowly and mindfully, aware of how this activity may evoke emotions in the other, read each aspect of their identity back to them, beginning the sentence with ‘You are’ instead of ‘I am’.

  After each aspect is read out, take a moment to pause and allow the person to receive the statement. As each is read out, invite the listener to notice the feelings and sensations that the activity invokes in them.

  Continue with this process, until you reach the end of the list, at which point the listener can take a few minutes to make some notes about their experience of the exercise.

  Invite the listener to take a couple of minutes to take notes on what the experience was like for them.

  Swap and repeat the exercise.

  **Useful prompts for the reflection: **

  What feelings did you notice came up as you listened back to the different aspects of your identity?

  Which aspects of your identity did you feel most connected to?

  Which aspects of your identity did you feel most resistant to?

  Make a note of anything else that you noticed that felt significant to you.

  If you are doing this activity with another person, Invite the listener to swap roles with the reader and repeat the exercise again.

  Group Discussion:

  After both people in the pair have completed the exercise, invite them to share their experiences with each other for 5 minutes.

  When the pairs have finished their discussion, invite them to feedback something from their discussions to the whole group.

  Useful prompts for the discussion:

  What has this activity taught you about how you see yourself?

  What has this activity taught you about what identity means?
