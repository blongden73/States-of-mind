title: Explore your relationship with your body
date: 2021-04-30 20:24:00 Z
Form: "Everybody has a unique and personal relationship with their body. Our relationship
  with our body is influenced by our past experiences of our body throughout our lives.
  By exploring our past relationship with our body we can develop a closer understanding
  and connection with it and learn why we sometimes resist paying attention to our
  physical aspect of ourselves. \n\nThis exercise will help you to explore past experiences
  where you have had positive and more difficult experiences of your body. This will
  help you to recognise where feelings of resistance come from and emerge and also
  to appreciate and value how your body can feel when you are connected with it. \n\nTake
  some time to pause and reflect on the following questions and note down any answers
  that come to you as you reflect.\n\n<form id=\"test-form\">\n  <div>\n    <label>When
  you were a child, what memories do you have of using your body to help you explore
  the world and to do things that you enjoyed? This may be using your hands to make
  things, your arms to climb trees or your eyes to read books. Describe a memory where
  you used your body to explore the world. </label>\n    <textarea type=\"text\" name=\"relationship_with_our_body\"
  placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"></textarea>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label>At
  what points in your life have you felt most strong, healthy and agile?  What were
  you doing at these points in your life and what was your average day like?</label>\n

  your answer here\"></textarea>\n  </div>\n<div>\n    <label>At what points in your
  life have you felt most tired, lethargic and tense? What was happening in your life
  at the time and what was your average day like? </label>\n    <input type=\"text\"

  \ </div>\n  <div>\n    <label>What things have you enjoyed doing throughout your

  in your life when you used your body to escape from difficult emotions? For example
  overeating, drinking or taking drugs? How did you feel about your body at these
  times?</label>\n    <textarea type=\"text\" name=\"relationship_with_our_body_e\"
  placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"></textarea>\n  </div>\n<div>\n    <label>What
