This activity has been designed to help you reflect on the positive and supportive relationships in your life, so that you can identify which relationships have healthy qualities and remember the emotional resources that you have available to you. 

Make a list of the relationships you have that often bring you a feeling of comfort and reassurance. This could include different types of relationships, like family, friendships, teachers, people from your community or people you have met in the past who you would like to reconnect with. 

When you feel happy that you have identified all of the people in your life who represent positive and supportive relationships, write a second list, thinking about each person individually and writing down the types of challenges and difficulties that you find these people help you to manage and overcome. 

You can also write the qualities in the person that you admire, appreciate and are grateful for.  

You can draw these people or represent the map of these relationships in any way that feels comfortable for you. You may want to draw a web of relationships and find ways of connecting the different people and types of support that they provide you with. Visually representing these relationships and what they bring to your life can provide a valuable resource for you when you are feeling upset, distressed or struggling with a particular issue. 

If you feel like it is difficult to identify people who represent healthy relationships in your life, you can create a list of people who you feel like you could reach out to support. These might be people who you know but have not asked for support from before. In this case, you can write a list of these people and write a list of why you believe they could provide a supportive influence in your life. Again, you can make a list of the types of challenges they may be able to help you with and the types of situations where you could ask for help from them.  

At the beginning of this module, you learned how the quality of our relationships is one of the strongest indicators of somebody’s mental, emotional and physical wellbeing. As you progressed through this module, you may have developed insights about your relationships and ways of relating to people that you didn't have before. Take the time to capture these insights. We recommend journaling as a method to capture the insights, so that you can reflect back on the notes later and keep them as a resource for your future learning. 

If you would like to have some support with the process of journaling, you can access our resource called ‘How to develop a reflective practice’ that is accessible on the state of mind website.
