Activating the Task Positive Network  

For this activity you can do this on your own, using a mirror or you can do it with a friend or group of people. 

Materials needed: Paper, pen. 
Timer 
Mirror if doing it on your own. 

Chose a partner to draw or set up your mirror so that you can see yourself clearly. Set the timer for 30 seconds. You have 30 seconds to draw a self portrait or a portrait of a friend, without looking at your piece of paper as you draw but only looking at your reflection or your friends face. Try and draw as much as possible in the 30 seconds.  

Doing this exercise activates your Task Positive Network. Notice the difference between how your mind felt during this activity compared to worrying about your problems. You can activate this network doing several tasks like this, that you enjoy. 

Write down a list of activities that come to mind that you could do when you are stuck in a place of worry.
