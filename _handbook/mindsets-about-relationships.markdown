Form: "Mindsets are the perceptions we hold towards people, situations and events
  based on our past experiences that we have internalised.  Mindsets reflect the beliefs
  and feelings that we hold onto that influence how we perceive the world around us.
  By exploring our mindsets towards relationships we can uncover the unconscious forces
  that shape our feelings and behaviour. \n<form id=\"test-form\">\n  <div>\n    <label>What
  Mindsets do you have about the levels of connection you are able to feel with others?</label>\n
