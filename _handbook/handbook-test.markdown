# Working with mindsets 

## Step 1. 

Reflect on the mindsets you have around some of the following things: 

Education, romantic relationships, social media, politics, the future. 

Choose one of the areas to focus on. 

Write down whatever views and mindsets you have around this topic. 

Take time to reflect on each statement you have written and consider how strongly you hold these mindsets. 

Rate each mindset on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the strongest. 

Choose one of the strongest mindsets you have to work with in step 2. 


## Step 2: 

How does this mindset affect your feelings and behaviour? 

How long have you had this mindset? 

How did this mindset first develop? 

How does this mindset serve you? ( How has it helped you or provided you with something?) 

How does this mindset limit you? ( How does it hold you back or prevent you from seeing other perspectives of yourself and others?) 

If you detach from this mindset, what other ways of seeing yourself and others begin to emerge?
