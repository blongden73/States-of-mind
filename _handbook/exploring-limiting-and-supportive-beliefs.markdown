    <div>
      <label>How has this belief helped you to understand yourself and your capabilities?</label>

  Now we can do the same with limiting beliefs. Think of a situation where you had a belief that was connected with an uncomfortable emotion. You don’t need to name the belief exactly if it is difficult to do so but it is important that you get a sense of it and what it was like. Now replay the situation and remember how the situation unfolded.
    <div>
      <label>How did the belief affect how you thought about yourself, how you acted and how you approached the situation?</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="limiting_b" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>How did this belief influence your perception of what you were capable of and who you are?</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="limiting_c" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></textarea>
    </div>
  <div>
      <label>What is your username?</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Type your answer here"/></input>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit"id="submit-form">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </form>
  Everybody has beliefs and they are not wrong or right, the purpose of exploring your beliefs is to notice which beliefs are connected with uncomfortable emotions and which beliefs are connected with positive and helpful emotions that allow you to live in ways you want to live. When you feel an uncomfortable belief the best thing to do is to sit with the fear and write down what the belief is that is connected with the feeling of fear. You can explore your belief and think about where it came from. Did you create the belief or did it come from somewhere else? If you created the belief that means you have the power to change it. If the belief came from somebody else then you also have the power to change it to a more helpful belief that will allow you to approach things differently.

  Belief is the foundation of our actions as our beliefs shape our mindsets about ourselves and the world. When we have positive and helpful beliefs it allows us to do things with a positive attitude towards ourselves and other people. When we have limiting beliefs, we are more likely to encounter problems and feel stuck when we have to do something that is important to us. By recognising how our fears and beliefs come hand in hand we can create more space to find other ways of feeling and other ways of approaching the many things we want to do in our lives.

**Limiting beliefs and supportive beliefs**

Some beliefs are attached to positive emotions and some beliefs have uncomfortable emotions attached to them. When a belief has an uncomfortable emotion attached to it, we call it a limiting belief. When a belief has a positive emotion attached to it we call it a supportive belief.

Why don’t you explore some of your supportive beliefs and see how these supportive beliefs have helped you in the past?

Think of a situation where you had a belief that was connected with a positive emotion. What happened in this situation where you brought your supportive belief to a task, situation or personal relationship. Notice how the belief made you act and notice how the belief had an effect on the way that you approached what you did.
