Form: "Step 1: \n\nChoose what you want to work with. It’s often easier to begin with
  a person with whom you have difficulty (e.g., partner, relative, boss).\n\nThis
  person may irritate, disturb, annoy, or upset you. Or maybe you feel attracted to,
  obsessed with, infatuated with, or possessive about this person.\n\nChoose someone
  with whom you have a strong emotional charge, whether positive or negative.\n\nStep
  2: Face it: \n\nNow, imagine this person. Describe those qualities that most upset
  you, or the characteristics you are most attracted to using 3rd-person language
  (he, she, it).\n\nTalk about them out loud or write it down in a journal. Express
  your feelings.\n\nDon’t calculate the right thing to say. There is no need to be
  nice. The person you are describing will never see this.\n\nStep 3: \n\nTalk to
  it: Dialogue with this person in your imagination. Speak in the 2nd person to this
  person (using “you” language).\n\nTalk directly to this person as if he or she was
  there. Tell them what bothers you about them.\n\nAsk them questions such as:\n\nWhy
  are you doing this to me?\nWhat do you want from me?\nWhat are you trying to show
  me?\nWhat do you have to teach me?\nImagine their response to these questions. Speak
  that imaginary response out loud. Record the conversation in your journal if you
  like.\n\nStep 4: \n\nTake on the qualities that either annoy or fascinate you.\n\nEmbody
  the traits you described in step 2. Use 1st-person language ( I, me, mine).\n\nThis
  may feel awkward, and it should. The traits you are taking on are the exact traits
  you have been denying in yourself.\n\nUse statements such as:\n\nI am angry.\nI
  am jealous.\nI am radiant.\n\nFill in the blank with whatever qualities you are
  working with: “I am __________.”\n\nStep 5: Notice these disowned qualities in yourself.\n\nExperience
  the part of you that is this trait. Avoid making the process abstract or conceptual:
  just BE it.\n\nNow you can re-own and integrate this quality in yourself.\n"
