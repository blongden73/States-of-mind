**A letter to your past self. **

When we write to ourselves in the third person as if we were speaking to a friend, it allows us to zoom out and reflect on our experience with the same empathy and compassion we feel for others. Take this opportunity, if you feel you would like to, to try writing a letter to yourself, in relation to your experiences in relationships.  
 
Reflect on the last 3 years of your life and think of the significant relationships you have had and the parts of these relationships that you value and acknowledge as meaningful and significant. You can also tune into the parts of your relationships that you have struggled with and practice relating to yourself with compassion towards these parts of your experience, by reflecting on how you have survived and coped with them. 

If you like, you can use these prompts to guide you:

When you reflect on the last 3 years of your life, what relationships felt like they had the most significance in your life?

**What do you value and acknowledge about these relationships as you reflect?** 

**What parts of your relationships have you struggled with, or have caused you distress? What would you like your past self to know?**

**What would you like to tell your past self now, based on what you have learned from your experiences in relationships in the last 3 years?**   

Remember to bring an attitude of kindness and compassion to yourself, as you would a close friend who you love and care for dearly.
