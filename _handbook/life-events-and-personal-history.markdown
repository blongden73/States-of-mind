  Notice what memories and associations naturally emerge as you begin to reflect. Your mind will naturally connect with certain images, memories, feelings and associations. If you have many memories come to mind, you may like to make a list of them so that you can come back to them later. If you can only think of a few, there’s no pressure, some may come later, as you progress with the activity and if they don’t it’s ok just to focus on a few.

  Step 5: Begin to represent these stages in your life visually. This can be through drawings, symbols, words or any other visual representation that feels right for you. Take some time to draw these events in the order that they happened. As you begin to draw, make a note next to the drawing of any feelings that emerge as you remember this time in your life and any significant insights or associations you have about the meaning they had for you.

  **Step 6: ** When you have completed your visual ( or written ) representation of the significant events of your life, take some time to step back and look at this representation of your life.
  When you feel ready, consider the following questions:

      <label>What parts of your life do you think have influenced your identity the most?</label>

# PART 1

This practice has been designed to help you reflect on the events in your life that have shaped your identity. When you have finished the activity you will have a visual and annotated record of key events throughout your life and the significance that they had for you.

**Step 1:** Find a calm environment where you will be undisturbed and can focus your attention on the activity. If you have chosen to do the activity in pairs or in a group, choose a setting where you have enough space to feel like you have a sense of privacy while you complete the activity.

There is no need to share your work with others but it can be very beneficial to express the insights you gain from the exercise with somebody you trust and feel comfortable with.

**Step 2:** You will need a pen and paper. You can coloured pens and other drawing materials if you have access to them and would like to develop your work creatively,

**Step 3:** When you are ready, settle yourself into a comfortable position and take as many slow, deep breaths as you need to feel relaxed and focused on the present moment. It can be helpful to affirm to yourself that this activity is for your personal development and any distractions can wait until you have taken this time for yourself.

**Step 4:** Take a few minutes to reflect on and visualise the significant times in your life from childhood through to the present. You may wish to use these prompts to help you as begin your reflection.
