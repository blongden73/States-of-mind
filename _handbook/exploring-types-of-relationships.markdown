date: 2021-04-30 18:49:00 Z
Form: "The purpose of this activity is to map out the different types of relationships
  that you have in your life and how these different relationships differ from each
  other. \n\nMap out with a piece of paper and pen, all of the relationships that
  you presently have in their your life. Categorise these relationships into different
  groups. Some examples of these different relationship types may be: Family, friendships,
  school, community, clubs and societies, religious groups, social media. \n\nYou
  can draw different people or write down who these people are, whatever your preference.
  \n\nAfter you have mapped all of these relationships, reflect on what parts of yourself
  you bring to these different relationships. You can create a character of yourself,
  or write down a list of qualities and attributes that capture the parts of you that
  these relationships draw out. For example, you may have a group of best friends
  and a group of friends who you know less well. You may notice that you show up in
  different ways within these different relationships.  \n\nAs an option, you can
  go into more detail on your relationship map by labelling your drawing/graph/infographic
  with the following information. \n\n\n<form id=\"test-form\">\n  <div>\n    <label>How
  long have you had this relationship for? </label>\n    <textarea type=\"text\" name=\"Types_of_Relationships\"
  placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"></textarea>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label>What
  is your favourite part about this relationship? </label>\n    <textarea type=\"text\"
  name=\"Types_of_Relationships_b\" placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"></textarea>\n
  \ </div>\n<div>\n    <label>What have you learnt about yourself from having this
  relationship? </label>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"Types_of_Relationships_c\"
  placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"></input>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label>What
  part of yourself does this relationship bring out?</label>\n    <textarea type=\"text\"
  name=\"Types_of_Relationships_d\" placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"></textarea>\n
  \ </div>\n  <div>\n    <label>What is your username?</label>\n    <input type=\"text\"
  name=\"username\" placeholder=\"Type your answer here\"></input>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n
  \   <button type=\"submit\"id=\"submit-form\">Submit</button>\n  </div>\n</form>\n\n"
