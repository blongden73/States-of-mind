The purpose of this activity is to map out the different types of relationships that you have in your life and how these different relationships differ from each other. 

Map out with a piece of paper and pen, all of the relationships that you presently have in their your life. Categorise these relationships into different groups. Some examples of these different relationship types may be: Family, friendships, school, community, clubs and societies, religious groups, social media. 

You can draw different people or write down who these people are, whatever your preference. 

After you have mapped all of these relationships, reflect on what parts of yourself you bring to these different relationships. You can create a character of yourself, or write down a list of qualities and attributes that capture the parts of you that these relationships draw out. For example, you may have a group of best friends and a group of friends who you know less well. You may notice that you show up in different ways within these different relationships.  

As an option, you can go into more detail on your relationship map by labelling your drawing/graph/infographic with the following information.
