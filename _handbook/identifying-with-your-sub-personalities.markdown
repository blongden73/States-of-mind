1. Consider, one of your prominent traits, attitudes or ways of being.
2. With your eyes closed, become aware of this part of you. Then let an image emerge that represents this part of you.  It may be a person, an object, an animal or a symbol. Allow the image to become clearer without judging or wanting to change it. Bring a curious attitude to the image, noticing how it is behaving, what it is wearing, itâ€™s posture and general attitude. 
3. Allow the image to express itself, notice if it wants to say anything or not. What feelings does it give off? You can speak to this part of you and ask it what it wants. Notice if it responds. 
4. Now open your eyes, and draw a visual representation of this sub-personality and record in a notebook everything that happened so far. 
5. Give this sub-personality a name - any name that fits and will allow you to identify it in the future. Some examples are: The complainer, the artist, the skeptic, the insecure one, the know it all.
6. After you have identified and exhaustively described one sub-personality you can go on to the others. But take your time and work on each one alone until you feel finished. The process requires picking a few more of your prominent traits, attitudes or motives and going through steps 1 to 5 for each one. 

Make some notes on the following questions: 
* How well do you know this part of you? 
* How do you feel about this part of you? 
* How do you feel when this part of you behaves the way it does in the world?  
* What does this part of you show to the world? 
* What does this part of you hide?
