Find a partner to try this activity with. Chose who will be the speaker and who will be the listener. 

Set a timer for 3 minutes on your phone. Ask the person to speak for 3 minutes about one of their favourite memories. Before beginning the activity make sure you have read the following instructions: 

1. Be attentive. Be interested. Be alert and not distracted. Create a positive atmosphere through nonverbal behaviour.

2. Be a sounding board -- allow the speaker to bounce ideas and feelings off you while assuming a nonjudgmental, non-critical manner.

3. Only ask 'clarifying questions'. These are questions that enable you to check that you understood what the speaker meant if you are unsure. 

4. Act like a mirror -- reflect back what you hear the speaker saying when you feel they are a bit stuck and not sure what to say next. Reflect back both what they said and how you notice they are feeling as they speak. 

5. Don't discount the speaker's feelings by using stock phrases like "It's not that bad," or "You'll feel better tomorrow."

6. Don't let the speaker "hook" you. This can happen if you get angry or upset, allow yourself to get involved in an argument, or pass judgment on the other person.

7. Indicate you are listening by:
   • Providing brief, acknowledging responses, e.g., "Uh-huh," "I see."
   • Giving nonverbal acknowledgements, e.g., head nodding, facial expressions matching the speaker, open and relaxed body expression, eye contact.
   • Invitations to say more, e.g., "Tell me about it," "I'd like to hear about that."

8. Follow good listening "ground rules:"
   • Don't interrupt.
   • Don't change the subject or move in a new direction.
   • Don't rehearse in your own head.
   • Don't interrogate.
   • Don't teach.
   • Don't give advice.
   • **Do** reflect back to the speaker what you understand and how you think the speaker feels.  

After you have finished practicing the listening skills, ask the speaker how they felt to be listened to like this. How was this different from normal conversation? How did it make them feel? 

Invite the speaker to make some notes on what it felt like to be listened to like this. 

When you are both ready, swap roles and repeat the exercise. 

You are now ready to start practicing empathic listening in your everyday life!
