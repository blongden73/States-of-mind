Think of a situation that you don’t know the outcome to. Maybe you are taking an exam and you don’t know the outcome of what the test will be.

Visualise yourself in the situations allow a really clear image to come to mind of you being there, in that moment.

Imagine everything in the room, the way it smells, the way it look and the way it feels to be there. Zoom out so you are the observer.

Now bring the problem to mind. 

Question:

What is the question you want to know the answer to or the part of the situation that you feel stuck about?

Ask yourself what you need in the situation and what would help your future self to feel better in that situation.

Question:

What would you need in that situation to feel supported, confident and able to do whatever you needed to do?




Allow the ideas to come to mind from your future self and thank them for the answers that they give you.

The things that you imagine your future self needing are the things that you can use to solve your problem and create a different outcome. This is the power of the imagination.

It allows us to create and access different possibilities to those things we are experiencing in the present moment and when we see there are alternatives, we are more likely to believe they are true.

Problems are only problems because we think they can’t be fixed but possibilities provide us with different solutions and outcomes to a problem we are struggling with.

Question:

What are the outcomes you want from the situation? 





If you struggle with the visualisation exercise because you are feeling that your emotions are very strong.  

You can solve the problem by thinking about the best outcome and asking yourself what you would need to do to help you get there.

Think of as many possibilities as you can and chose the possibility that feels most right for you.
