  When we take time to feel grateful, initially it can feel very tricky. As we practice it gets easier to identify the things in life we feel lucky for. We are able to appreciate what we have and studies have shown that this has a notable impact on our wellbeing.
  <form id="test-form">
    <div>
      <label>What are you grateful for? List at least five things.</label>
      <textarea type="text" name="Gratitude_Reflection" placeholder="Type your answer here"></textarea>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>What is your username?</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Type your answer here"></input>
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit"id="submit-form">Submit</button>
    </div>
  </form>
  If this feels tricky, start with general things like the Earth or having air to breathe.  Sometimes it can help to go back to things you have enjoyed doing and list those, maybe you are grateful to be able to watch films and this could lead to gratitude for eyes or colours or animators.

  Nothing is too big or too small.

  Now, using one or two examples, take some time to explore why you feel grateful for these things. What is it about them that makes you feel grateful? How are you lucky to have them? How can you appreciate them more in your life?

  If it is a person maybe consider writing them a note, sending a text or telling them that you feel grateful for them.
