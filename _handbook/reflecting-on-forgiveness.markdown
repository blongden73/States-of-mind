  Think of a situation that you feel requires forgiveness.

  How were you hurt?
  What pain are you still carrying?

  Look at Enrightâ€™s steps for forgiveness. Think about what stands out for you, what do you feel you have done and what more can you do.

  What stage(s) do you feel like you are in and what do you feel still needs to be processed?
