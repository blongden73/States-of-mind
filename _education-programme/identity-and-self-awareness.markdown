  Title: 'What is self awareness? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Self awareness is the ability to notice our thoughts, feelings and
    behaviour, as if we are an observer.\nSelf awareness allows us to understand ourselves
    and the impact we have on others. \nSelf awareness is a tool that provides us
    with the power of choice, to redefine our narrative of how we experience ourselves.
    \nThrough practicing self awareness, we can make new choices about how we live
    our lives and enhance our sense of wellbeing. "

  Description: "Self awareness is one tool we can use to improve our wellbeing and
    shape our reality. However, if we are struggling emotionally due to the actions
    of others, experiencing abuse or other challenging experiences, it is not our
    responsibility to manage our problems alone and seeking help for these experiences
    is really important for our mental health.  \nLinks to helpful places that can

  Description: "# The Johari Window is a visual representation of aspects of the self
    that are known or unknown to ourselves and others. \n\n## Joseph Luft and Harrington
    Ingham \n\nThe open area represents everything we know about ourselves. This is
    what people who know us know about us and what we are consciously aware of too.
    \n\nThe hidden area relates to all of the parts of ourselves that we do not share
    with others. This information that we keep private may relate to our fears and
    insecurities swell as your hopes and dreams.  \n\nThe blind spot relates to our
    potential for personal growth through our close and trusted relationships. Our
    friends and family can provide us with feedback and honesty that can help us to
    see ourselves more clearly. This can relate to both our positive attributes and
    areas for growth. \n\nThe unknown relates to information about ourselves that
    is unconscious to both ourselves and others. This relates to parts of ourselves
    we still have yet to discover through new experiences. \n\n"

  Title: 
  Image: 
  Description: "Self Awareness has been proven as a tool that can help us to flourish.\n\nThe
    insight that self awareness provides allows us to feel more satisfied with our
    lives. \n\nWhen cultivated fully, we no longer repress or hide our emotions or
    experiences and instead see them as ways to learn and grow.  \n\nSelf awareness
    allows us to develop insight into our problems, behaviours and personal experiences.
    \n\nThis process of bringing conscious awareness to how we are living is the first
    step to having confidence that we can change our lives to be more positive and
    fulfilling. Without this insight and this belief in change, it is very difficult
    to know we can develop ourselves and we can become stuck feeling as if we have
    no control over how things are. \n\nHarrington, Rick,Loffredo, Donald 2010/11/30,

    of psychology"

  Description: "# Self awareness enables us to take responsibility for our problems.
    \n\nBy developing this self-knowledge we can understand ourselves and personal
    experience more fully. This allows us to determine where our problems are coming
    from so that we can begin to resolve them. \n\n# Self awareness improves our relationship
    with ourselves and others. \n\nBy being more aware of how we are acting towards
    ourselves and in our relationships, we can improve the quality of these relationships,
    which are key to experiencing a fulfilling life.  \n\n# Self awareness improves
    our confidence and self esteem. \n\nPeople with self awareness have more clarity
    about who they are, what they believe in and what their personal goals are. Without
    this clarity, it can be easy to lack self assurance and struggle with low self
    esteem."

  Title: 'How can self awareness impact how we experience our identity? '
  Image: 
  Description: "\nWe like to think of ourselves as one consistent personality or person
    but in reality, we are composed of many different aspects and parts, that all
    serve an important role in our lives. \nSelf awareness allows us to recognise
    that our identity is not fixed but is an ever-changing reflection of our experiences,
    values and relationships. Self awareness allows us to explore the emotional connection
    or resistance we have to them.  \n\nBy exploring the different aspects of our
    personal identity we can gain a deeper understanding of what makes us unique and
    what connects us most fundamentally with others.  \n\nWe can then develop insights
    into the causes of our problems and our potential for growth, and recover our
    gifts and qualities that we are blind to.  "

  Title: Identity
  Image: 
  Description: "Our definition of identity isn’t fixed as we view it as a subjective
    and personal experience of how we chose to view ourselves. \n\nOur identity relates
    to our self - image:  our perception of our value and our role in the world. Our
    identity changes and evolves as we develop, reflecting the dynamic inter-relationship
    between our life experience and our sense of self. \n\n\nAs our life history and
    identity are so closely related, exploring and bringing awareness to different
    aspects of our identity can provide an important foundation for self-discovery,
    self awareness and personal growth. \n\nExploring our identity can make us aware
    of past experiences that can bring up uncomfortable feelings and memories. While
    practicing these exercises, it’s important to remember that your identity is never
    fixed and that giving ourselves space and time to process and feel our reactions
    to parts of our identity is part of the healing process. "

  Title: How does identity relate to how we live?
  Image: 
  Description: "Everyday we have an experience of who we are. Sometimes this is a
    positive experience that affirms a clear and motivated sense of ourselves in the
    world, while at other times we can experience ourselves as struggling, unable
    to cope and helpless to our challenges. \n\nOur mental health is reflected in
    our self image and so by developing the ability to reflect on ourselves we can
    develop more emotional and mental flexibility over how we experience our self
    image. This skill can be developed throughout life and is crucial for our mental
    health, relationships and general enjoyment of life. "
