  Title: 'So what is self awareness? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Self awareness is the experience of noticing your thoughts, feelings
    and behaviour, as if you are an observer.\n\nIt also allows you to step back and
    understand yourself and how you are affected by other people. \n\nBy developing
    your levels of self awareness, you can access a sense of choice around how you
    respond to life's challenges. Over time, you can experience a deep connection
    with your most authentic self. "

  Title: Self awareness is a tool that can help us to grow
  Image: 
  Description: "\nThe **insights** that self awareness provides you with allow you
    to feel more satisfied with your life because you become more aware of why you
    feel and act the way you do. \n\nWhen cultivated fully, you no longer feel the
    need to repress or hide your emotions or react unconsciously to your experiences
    but will view yourself with a deeper level of understanding. \n"

  Description: "# Self awareness enables you to:\n\n# Take responsibility for your
    problems.\n\nBy developing knowledge about yourself and understanding yourself
    more fully, you can determine where your problems are coming from so that you
    can begin to resolve them more easily. \n\n# Improve your relationships \n\nBy
    being more aware of how you are acting towards yourself and in your relationships,
    you can improve the quality of these relationships, which are so key for experiencing
    a fulfilling life.  \n\n# Improve your confidence \n\nPeople with self awareness
    have more clarity about who they are, what they believe in and what their personal
    goals are. Without this clarity, it can be easy to lack self assurance and struggle
    with your self esteem."

    your life history and identity are so closely related, exploring and bringing
    awareness to different aspects of your identity can provide an important foundation
    for self-discovery, self awareness and personal growth. "

    are very familiar with this part of their identity, yet they do not always pause
    to consider the meaning their name has for them. \n\nThe act of bringing conscious
    awareness to an aspect of yourself such as your name allows you to connect more
    deeply with your sense of who you are and the meaning it holds for you. \n\n<iframe

  Title: Authenticity and mental health
  Image: "/uploads/Jung.jpg"
  Description: "Carl Jung was a Swiss Psychologist who explored the personality and
    human nature. \n\nJung believed that ‘individuation’ was the main purpose of human
    development. \n\nIndividuation is the process through which a person achieves
    a sense of individuality separate from the identities of others. \n\nHis idea
    was that psychological health is achieved by seeking to live as authentically
    as you can ( to feel and act in accordance with who you most essentially are).

  Title: 'What is our authentic self ? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Under the many layers of your identity and your personality is your
    true self, this part of you never changes but exists throughout your life as your
    innermost being. This part of yourself exists independently of your thoughts,
    feelings and roles that you play in the world. \n\nWhen you are connected with
    your authentic self, you are able to live freely, without feeling the need to
    be anybody else. In this place, you accept your qualities, attributes and innate
    gifts and can live according to who you most essentially are. \n\nThroughout your
    life, you change and adapt parts of yourself to maintain your relationships with
    others and to fit in to who you think other people want you to be. Everyone experiences
    this conflict between wanting to be true to themselves and wanting to fit in with
    the world around them. \n\nThis next part of the module will explore the authentic
    self and how you develop the different ‘masks’ or sub-personalities that you show
    to the world."

    to reconnect with your essential nature. \n\nAs a young child, you do not change
    or adapt your behaviour for others but express your needs, interests and sense
    of self authentically. \n\nBy reconnecting with your younger self, you can discover
    and reclaim lost qualities of yourself and bring them into your present life to
    help you. \n\nThis is a therapeutic process that can help you to develop your
    self awareness and self esteem."

  Title: 'Personality '
  Image: "/uploads/mask.jpg"
  Description: "Personality comes from the greek word ‘persona’ which means mask.
    \n\nYour personality refers to the different ways you express yourself in the
    world and the many different ways you relate with other people. \n\nTogether with
    your personality you have an unchanging part of who you you are that psychologists
    call the 'Self'. This is the part of you that does not change over time or adapt
    to different circumstances, but is your essential nature. \n\nYour Self is the
    part of you that is spontaneous and loving, that seeks to be known and is the
    experience of who you most fundamentally are.\n"

  Title: 'The psychology of Sub-personalities '
  Image: 
  Description: "Subpersonalities are habits or patterns of behaviour that you have
    followed since childhood.\n\nWhen people fail to respond empathetically to your
    true personality, you learn to hide your authentic nature and adapt to how your
    parents or other people tell you that you should be. \n\nA psychotherapist called
    Winnicott also called this process of adapting, the development of the False Self.
    It has also been referred to as the Survival Personality or 'Character Armour'. \n "

  Description: "They are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that
    you develop to adapt to various environments where you feel unable to be your
    authentic self.\n\nIn neuroscience these are viewed as distinct neural networks
    that function as ‘specialised selves’ or ‘self states’. \n\nSub-personality theory
    explains personality development and helps to explain why parts of your personality
    can feel conflicted and as if there are ‘multiple selves’ within you who have
    different ways of being.\n\nFor example the feeling of ‘I want to do this but
    another part of me wants to do that’, or ‘ I am angry right now but I think its
    important I tell the truth’"

  Title: How are sub-personalities related to mental health? 
  Image: 
  Description: "Subpersonalities cause difficulties when you identify with this one
    part of yourself and believe it to be all of you. \n\nFor example, if you are
    identified with the ‘High achiever’ part of yourself, it may help you to get good
    grades and maintain a motivation for developing your knowledge and experience.
    However, if you become over identified with this part of yourself you may become
    very distressed by setbacks, you may spend less time with our friends or you may
    never be satisfied with what you have achieved. \n\nYour sub personalities all
    emerge from an unmet need.By identifying these needs you can develop more self
    awareness and understanding of your behaviour. \n\nBy bringing awareness to your
    different sub personalities you can integrate them and enable the different parts
    of your personality to work together as a harmonious whole."

  Title: What are the benefits of sub-personality work? 
  Image: 
  Description: "1. You learn to connect with your different and contradictory ways
    of acting in the world. This raises your awareness of your behaviour and helps
    you to make sense of how you can seem to be different versions of yourself in
    different circumstances.\n\n2. You learn to free yourself of the unconscious forces
    that cause you to get trapped in certain aspects of your personality. \nFor example,
    a very critical part of yourself. \n\n3. You integrate the different aspects of
    your personality which causes you to feel less conflict within yourself.\n\n4.
    You emphasise all of the beneficial qualities of your sub-personalities and recognise
    how they serve you.\n\n5. By identifying with your different sub-peronalities,
    it allows you to develop a greater awareness of what is your true self and what
    is a mask or persona."

  Description: "You live in a social world and many aspects of your personality is
    shaped by the social relationships and situations you encounter throughout your
    life. \n\nAs it is impossible for your close relationships to be fully present
    all the time and for you to be completely present to others, you fit your environments
    by adapting your personality to defend yourself and meet your needs for connection.\n
    \ \nAn example of this is noticing when somebody seems to have a different personality
    depending on what group they are in, or when you notice you behave differently
    depending on who you are with. \n\nThis is a completely normal process but understanding
    the process behind it can help you develop an awareness of how parts of your identity
    are shaped by your desire to fit in and be accepted in contrast to expressing
    your authentic feelings and experince when you are with others. "

    **Values, Beliefs and Behaviour**

    One of the strongest factors that influence and reflect your sense of identity are the groups that you are a part of in your life.

    From the moment you are born, you are a part of your family group. As you grow and develop, you encounter new groups at school or in our local community. Throughout your whole life, out of choice or out of circumstance, you will spend your times in groups that have an influence on you and which reflect your values, beliefs and mindsets about who you are.

    Groups provide a sense of belonging, which is one of the most important needs in terms of mental health and wellbeing. Research has shown consistently that the quality of your social world is one of the most significant indicators of your wellbeing and ability to recover from difficult times in your life.
