  Title: 'So what is self awareness? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Self awareness is the experience of noticing our thoughts, feelings
    and behaviour, as if we are an observer.\n\nIt also allows us to step back and
    understand both ourselves and how we are in relationship with others. \n\nBy developing
    our levels of self awareness, we can access a sense of choice around how we respond
    to life's challenges. Over time, we can experience a deep connection with our
    most authentic self. "

  Description: "# Self awareness enables us to:\n\n# Take responsibility for our problems.\n\nBy
    developing self-knowledge we can understand ourselves more fully. This helps us
    to determine where our problems are coming from so that we can begin to resolve
    them. \n\n# Improve our relationships \n\nBy being more aware of how we are acting
    towards ourselves and in our relationships, we can improve the quality of these
    relationships, which are key to experiencing a fulfilling life.  \n\n# Improve
    our confidence \n\nPeople with self awareness have more clarity about who they
    are, what they believe in and what their personal goals are. Without this clarity,
    it can be easy to lack self assurance and struggle with our self esteem."

  Image: 
  Description: "\nThe **insights** that self awareness provides us with allow us to
    feel more satisfied with our lives because we become more aware of why we feel
    and act the way we do. \n\nWhen cultivated fully, we no longer feel the need to
    repress or hide our emotions or react unconsciously to our experiences but view
    ourselves with a deeper level of understanding. \n"

    ## The Johari Window

    The Johari Window is a visual representation of the parts of ourselves that are  either known or unknown to ourselves and others.

    **The open area** represents everything we know about ourselves. This is what people know about us and what we are consciously aware of too.

    **The hidden area** relates to all of the parts of ourselves that we do not share with others. This information that we keep private may relate to our fears and insecurities swell as your hopes and dreams.

    **The blind spot** relates to the parts of ourselves we are not aware of but that others know about us. This can relate to both our positive attributes and areas for growth.

    **The unknown** relates to information about ourselves that is unconscious to both ourselves and others. This relates to parts of ourselves we still have yet to discover through new experiences.

    subjective and personal and is influenced by our unique life experiences. \n\nAs
    our life history and identity are so closely related, exploring and bringing awareness
    to different aspects of our identity can provide an important foundation for self-discovery,
    self awareness and personal growth. "

  Description: "Our name is a personal and special aspect of our identity. It is a
    part of our identity that we are very familiar with, yet we do not always pause
    to consider the meaning our name has for us. \n\nThe act of bringing conscious
    awareness to an aspect of ourselves such as our name allows us to connect more
    deeply with our sense of who we are and the meaning this part of us has in our
    lives. "

  Title: Authenticity and mental health
  Image: "/uploads/Jung.jpg"
  Description: "Carl Jung was a Swiss Psychologist who explored the personality and
    human nature. \n\nJung believed that ‘individuation’ was the main purpose of human
    development. His idea was that psychological health is achieved by seeking to
    live as authentically as we can ( to feel and act in accordance with who we most
    essentially are).  \n\nHe believed that everybody had the ability and the impulse
    to move towards their fullest potential  and that this was achieved by becoming
    aware of the aspects of ourselves that we often ignore or are unconscious to.

  Title: 'What is our authentic self ? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Under the many layers of our identity and our personality is our true
    self, this part of us never changes but exists throughout our life as our innermost
    being. It exists independently of our thoughts, feelings and roles that we play
    in the world. When we are connected with our authentic self, we are able to live
    freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, we accept
    our qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who we most
    essentially are. \n\nThroughout our lives, we change and adapt parts of ourself
    to maintain our relationships with others and to fit in to who we think other
    people want us to be. We can all experience this conflict between wanting to be
    true to ourselves and wanting to fit in with the world around us. \n\nThis next
    part of the module will explore the authentic self and how we develop the different
    ‘masks’ or sub-personalities that we show to the world."

  Title: 'Inner child Practice '
  Image: "/uploads/child%202.jpg"
  Description: "The inner child practice is a therapeutic process that allows us to
    reconnect with our essential nature. \n\nAs young children, we do not change or
    adapt our behaviour for others but express our needs, interests and sense of self
    authentically. \n\nBy reconnecting with our younger self, we can discover and
    reintegrate lost qualities of ourselves and bring them into our present lives
    more fully. \n\nThis is a therapeutic process that can help us to develop our
    self awareness and self esteem."

  Image: "/uploads/mask.jpg"
  Description: "Personality comes from the greek word ‘persona’ which means mask.
    \n\nOur personality refers to the different ways we express ourselves in the world
    and the many different ways we relate with other people. Together with our personality
    we all have an unchanging part of who we are that psychologists call the 'Self'.
    This is the part of us that does not change over time or adapt to different circumstances,
    but is our essential nature. \n\nOur Self is the part of us that is spontaneous
    and loving, that seeks to be known and is the experience of who we most fundamentally
    are.\n"

  Title: 'The psychology of Sub-personalities '
  Image: 
  Description: "Subpersonalities are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have
    followed since childhood\n\nWhen people fail to respond empathetically to our
    true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents
    or our environment need us to be. \n\nA psychotherapist called Winnicott also
    called this process of adapting, the development of the False Self. It has also
    been referred to as the Survival Personality or 'Character Armour'. \n "

  Description: "They are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that
    we develop to adapt to various environments where we feel unable to be our authentic
    self. \n\nIn neuroscience these are viewed as distinct neural networks that function
    as ‘specialised selves’ or ‘self states’. ( Siegel 1993) \n\n\nSub-personality
    theory explains personality development and helps to explain why parts of our
    personality can feel conflicted and as if there are ‘multiple selves’ within us
    who have different ways of being.\n\nFor example the feeling of ‘ I want to do
    this but another part of me wants to do that’, or ‘ I shouldn’t be getting angry
    right now but I think its important I tell the truth’"

  Title: What are the benefits of sub-personality work? 
  Image: 
  Description: |
    1. We learn to connect with our different and contradictory ways of acting in the world. This raises our awareness of our behaviour and helps us to make sense of how we can seem to be different versions of ourselves in different circumstances.

     2. We learn to free ourselves of the unconscious forces that cause us to get trapped in certain aspects of our personality. For example, a very critical part of ourselves.

    3. We integrate the different aspects of our personality which causes us to feel less conflict within ourselves.

    4.We emphasise all of the beneficial qualities of our sub-personalities and recognise how they serve us.

    5. By identifying with our different sub-peronalities, it allows us to develop a greater awareness of what is our true self and what is a mask or persona.    Graphic Image:

  Title: How are sub-personalities related to mental health? 
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Subpersonalities cause us difficulties when we identify with this one part of ourselves and believe it to be all of us. For example, if we are identified with the ‘ High achiever’ part of ourselves, it may help us to get good grades and maintain a motivation for developing our knowledge and experience. However, if we become over identified with this part of ourselves we may become very distressed by setbacks, we may spend less time with our friends or we may never be satisfied with what we have achieved. 

    Our sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need. By exploring these parts of ourselves, we can develop our self awareness and integrate the many different parts of ourselves. You can imagine your sub-personalities as an orchestra and your awareness as the conductor. By bringing awareness to your different sub personalities you can integrate them and enable the different parts of your personality to work together as a harmonious whole.

    in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging,

    shaped by the social relationships and situations we encounter throughout our
    lives. \n\nAs it is impossible for our close relationships to be fully present
    all the time and for us to be completely present to others, we fit our environments
    by adapting our personality to defend ourselves or meet our needs for connection.\n
    \ \nAn example of this is noticing when somebody seems to have a different personality
    depending on what group they are in, or when we notice we behave differently depending
    on who we are with. \n\nThis is a completely normal process but understanding
    the process behind it can help us develop an awareness of how parts of our identity
    are shaped by our desire to fit in and be accepted in contrast to expressing our
    authentic self. "

    group. As we grow and develop, we encounter new groups at school or in our local
    community. \n\nThroughout our whole lives, out of choice or out of circumstance,
    we will spend our times in groups that have an influence on us and which reflect
    our values, beliefs and mindsets about who we are. \n\nGroups provide us with
    a sense of belonging, which is one of our most important needs in terms of our
    mental health and wellbeing. \n\nResearch has shown consistently that the quality
    of our social world is one of the most significant indicators of our wellbeing
    and ability to recover from difficult times in our lives.  "
