  Title: 'So what is self awareness? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Self awareness is our ability to notice our thoughts, feelings and
    behaviour, as if we are an observer.\n\nIt also allows us to understand ourselves
    and the impact we have on others. It is a tool that provides us with the power
    of choice, to redefine our narrative of how we experience ourselves. \n\nThrough
    practicing self awareness, we can make new choices about how we live our lives
    and enhance our sense of wellbeing. "

  Description: "# Self awareness enables us to \ntake responsibility for our problems.
    \n\nBy developing this self-knowledge we can understand ourselves and personal
    experience more fully. This allows us to determine where our problems are coming
    from so that we can begin to resolve them. \n\n# Self awareness improves \nour
    relationship with ourselves and others. \n\nBy being more aware of how we are
    acting towards ourselves and in our relationships, we can improve the quality
    of these relationships, which are key to experiencing a fulfilling life.  \n\n#
    Self awareness improves our \nconfidence and self esteem. \n\nPeople with self
    awareness have more clarity about who they are, what they believe in and what
    their personal goals are. Without this clarity, it can be easy to lack self assurance
    and struggle with low self esteem."

  Title: Self Awareness has been proven as a tool that can help us to flourish.
  Image: 
  Description: "\nThe **insight** that self awareness provides allows us to feel more
    satisfied with our lives by helping us to become aware of our emotions and behaviour.
    \n\nWhen cultivated fully, we no longer repress or hide our emotions or experiences
    and instead see them as ways to **learn and grow**.  \n\nThis process of bringing
    conscious awareness to how we are living is the first step to having confidence
    that we can change our lives to be more positive and fulfilling. \n\nWithout this
    insight and this **belief in change**, it is very difficult to know we that we
    can change our experience and we can become stuck feeling as if we have no control
    over how things are. \n\n"

    ## The Johari Window

    The Johari Window is a visual representation of the parts of ourselves that are  either known or unknown to ourselves and others.

    **The open area** represents everything we know about ourselves. This is what people who know us know about us and what we are consciously aware of too.

    **The hidden area** relates to all of the parts of ourselves that we do not share with others. This information that we keep private may relate to our fears and insecurities swell as your hopes and dreams.

    **The blind spot** relates to the parts of ourselves we are not aware of but that others know about us. This can relate to both our positive attributes and areas for growth.

    **The unknown** relates to information about ourselves that is unconscious to both ourselves and others. This relates to parts of ourselves we still have yet to discover through new experiences.

  Image: 
  Description: "\nWe like to think of ourselves as one consistent personality or person
    but in reality, we are composed of **many different aspects and parts**, that
    all serve an important role in our lives. \n\nSelf awareness allows us to recognise
    that our identity is not fixed but is an ever-changing reflection of our experiences,
    values and relationships.  \n \nWe can then develop insights into how we view
    ourselves, identify the causes of our problems and rediscover our potential for
    growth."

  Title: Identity, authenticity and mental health
  Image: "/uploads/Jung.jpg"
  Description: "Carl Jung was a Swiss Psychologist who explored the personality and
    human nature. He was responsible for introducing concepts such as introversion
    and extroversion and the collective unconcious. \nJung believed that ‘individuation’
    was a process that was the main purpose of human development. This idea was that
    psychological health is achieved by seeking to live authentically ( to feel and
    act in accordance with who we most essentially are).  He believed that everybody
    had the ability and the impulse to move towards our fullest potential  and that
    we achieved this by becoming aware of aspects of ourselves we ignore or are unconscious
    to, aswell as the unmanifested potential that exists within us. \nFor Jung, healing
    was a process of reconnecting with our true nature and rediscovering our unique
    and personal interests, desires and ways of being in the world. "

  Title: 'The younger you and the authentic self '
  Image: 
  Description: "Under the many layers of our identity and our personality is our true
    self, this part of us never changes and exists throughout our life as our innermost
    being. It exists independently of our thoughts, feelings and roles that we play
    in the world. When we are connected with our authentic self, we are able to live
    freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, we accept
    our qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who we most
    essentially are. \n\nThroughout our lives, we change and adapt parts of ourself
    to maintain our relationships with others and to fit in to what we think other
    people want us to be. This part of the module explores the conflict we can all
    experience between wanting to be true to ourselves and wanting to fit in with
    the world around us. \n\nThis next part of the module will explore the authentic
    self and the different ‘masks’ or sub-personalities that we show to the world. "

  Description: "The inner child is a psychological practice that allows us to reconnect
    with our essential nature. \nAs young children, we do not change or adapt our
    behaviour for others but express our needs, interests and sense of self authentically.
    \nBy reconnecting with our younger self, we can discover and reintegrate lost
    qualities of ourselves and bring them into our present lives more fully. This
    is a therapeutic process that can help us to develop our self awareness and self
    esteem."

  Description: |-
    Personality comes from the greek word, ‘persona’ which means mask. Our personality refers to the different faces that we show to the world and the many different ways we behave, speak, think and relate with other people. Behind our personality is our true Self, which does not change over time or adapt to different circumstances, but contains our essential nature.

    Sub personalities are distinct personality structures that we identify with and act out. Sub personalities develop when we feel we cannot express our true nature and need to adapt or change some aspect of ourselves to be loved, accepted and acknowledged. Sub personalities are not bad or something to be removed, they are a very normal part of psychological development as they allow us to survive and adapt to an unpredictable social world.

  Title: 'The psychology of Sub-personalities '
  Image: 
  Description: "Subpersonalities are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have
    followed since childhood\n\nWhen people fail to respond empathetically to our
    true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents
    or our environment need us to be. A psychotherapist called Winnicott, called this
    process of adapting, the development of the ‘False Self’. It is also referred
    to as the Survival Personality. \n\nThese are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings
    and behaviours that we develop to adapt to various environments where we feel
    unable to be our authentic self. In neuroscience these are viewed as distinct
    neural networks that function as ‘specialised selves’ or ‘self states’. ( Siegel
    1993) \n\nDaniel Stern summarises the psychological view on these multiple selves:
    ‘ It is now largely accepted that there are multiple ( context -specific) selves
    that can interact with each other, observe each other, and converse together out
    of consciousness. This is normal, not limited to pathological dissociative states.’
    (Stern 2004) \n\nSub-personality theory explains personality development and helps
    to explain why parts of our personality can feel conflicted and as if there are
    ‘multiple selves’ within us who have different ways of being. \n\nFor example
    the feeling of ‘ I want to do this but another part of me wants to do that’, or
    ‘ I shouldn’t be getting angry right now but I think its important I tell the
    truth’ "

  Title: How are sub-personalities related to mental health? 
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Subpersonalities cause us difficulties when we identify with this one part of ourselves and believe it to be all of us. For example, if we are identified with the ‘ High achiever’ part of ourselves, it may help us to get good grades and maintain a motivation for developing our knowledge and experience. However, if we become over identified with this part of ourselves we may become very distressed by setbacks, we may spend less time with our friends or we may never be satisfied with what we have achieved. 

    Our sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need. By exploring these parts of ourselves, we can develop our self awareness and integrate the many different parts of ourselves. You can imagine your sub-personalities as an orchestra and your awareness as the conductor. By bringing awareness to your different sub personalities you can integrate them and enable them to work together as a harmonious whole.

  Title: What are the benefits of sub-personality work? 
  Image: 
  Description: |
    1. We learn to connect with our different and contradictory ways of acting in the world. This raises our awareness of our behaviour and helps us to make sense of how we can seem to be different versions of ourselves in different circumstances.
     2. We learn to free ourselves of the unconscious forces that cause us to get trapped in certain aspects of our personality. For example, a very critical part of ourselves.
    3. We integrate the different aspects of our personality which causes us to feel less conflict within ourselves.
    4.We emphasise all of the beneficial qualities of our sub-personalities and recognise how they serve us.
    5. By identifying with our different sub-peronalities, it allows us to develop a greater awareness of what is our true self and what is a mask or persona.    Graphic Image:

  Description: "We live in a social world and many aspects of our personalities are
    shaped by the social relationships and situations we encounter throughout our
    lives. \nAs it is impossible for our close relationships to be fully present all
    the time and for us to be completely present to others, we have adapted a way
    to fit our environments by adapting our personality to defend ourselves or meet
    your need for connection.  \nAn example of this is noticing when somebody seems
    to have a different personality depending on what group they are in, or when we
    notice we behave differently depending on who we are. This is a completely normal
    process but understanding the process behind it can help us develop an awareness
    of how parts of our identity are shaped by our desire to fit in and be accepted. "

  Description: "**Values, Beliefs and Behaviour**\n\nOne of the strongest factors
    that influence and reflect our sense of identity are the groups that we are a
    part of in our lives. From the moment we are born, we are a part of our family
    group. As we grow and develop, we encounter new groups at school or in our local
    community. Throughout our whole lives, out of choice or out of circumstance, we
    will spend our times in groups that have an influence on us and which reflect
    our values, beliefs and mindsets about who we are. Groups provide us with a sense
    of belonging, which is one of our most important needs in terms of our mental
    health and wellbeing. \n\nResearch has shown consistently that the quality of
    our social world is one of the most significant indicators of our wellbeing and
    ability to recover from difficult times in our lives.  "

    our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never
    be greater than our level of self-acceptance.’ \nDaring Greatly by Brene Browne "
