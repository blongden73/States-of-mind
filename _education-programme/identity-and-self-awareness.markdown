  Title: 'So what is self awareness? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Self awareness is the experience of noticing your thoughts, feelings
    and behaviour, as if you are an observer.\n\nIt also allows you to step back and
    understand yourself and how you are affected by other people. \n\nBy developing
    your levels of self awareness, you can access a sense of choice around how you
    respond to life's challenges. Over time, you can experience a deep connection
    with your most authentic self. "

  Title: Self awareness is a tool that can help us to grow
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    The **insights** that self awareness provides you with allow you to feel more satisfied with your life because you develop your understanding of why you feel and act the way you do.

    When cultivated fully, you no longer feel the need to repress or hide your emotions or react unconsciously to your experiences but will view yourself with a deeper level of understanding.

    # Self awareness enables you to:

    # Take responsibility for your problems.

    By understanding yourself more fully, you can determine where your problems are coming from so that you can begin to resolve them more easily.

    # Improve your relationships

    By being more aware of how your feelings affect your behaviour,  you can improve your communication with others and express yourself more clearly in your close relationships.

    # Improve your confidence

    People with self awareness have more clarity about who they are, what they believe in and what their personal goals are. Without this clarity, it can be easy to lack self assurance and struggle with your self esteem.

    human nature. \n\nJung believed that ‘individuation’ was the main purpose of human
    development. \n\nIndividuation is the process through which a person achieves
    a sense of individuality separate from the identities of others. \n\nHis idea
    was that psychological health is achieved by seeking to live as authentically
    as you can ( to feel and act in accordance with who you most essentially are).

  Description: |-
    Under the many layers of your identity and your personality is your true self, this part of you never changes but exists throughout your life as your innermost being. This part of yourself exists independently of your thoughts, feelings and roles that you play in the world.

    When you are connected with your authentic self, you are able to live freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, you accept your qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who you most essentially are.

  Title: 'Personality '
  Image: "/uploads/mask.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Personality comes from the greek word ‘persona’ which means mask.

    Your personality refers to the different ways you express yourself in the world and the many different ways you relate with other people.

    Throughout your life, you may change and adapt parts of yourself to maintain your relationships with others and to fit in to who you think other people want you to be. Everyone experiences this conflict between wanting to be true to themselves and wanting to fit in with the world around them.

    This next part of the module will explore this process and how you develop the different ‘masks’ or sub-personalities that you show to the world.

  Title: 'The psychology of Sub-personalities '
  Image: 
  Description: "A subpersonality is a response pattern that causes us to act, feel
    and think in distinct ways. \n\nWhen people fail to respond empathetically to
    your true personality, or you feel uncomfortable being yourself, you learn to
    hide your authentic nature and adapt to how you think you should be.\n\nFor example,
    if you found that you got love and attention from your parents when you were helpful
    and didn't express your concerns, you may develop a 'people-pleaser' part of yourself.
    \n\nA psychotherapist called Winnicott also called this process of adapting, the
    development of the False Self. It has also been referred to as the Survival Personality
    or 'Character Armour'."

  Description: "Sub-personality theory explains personality development and helps
    to explain why parts of your personality can feel conflicted sometimes, as if
    there are ‘multiple selves’ within you who have different ways of being. \n\nFor
    example, you may have a part of you that is very rebellious and another part of
    you that is very responsible. \n\nBy exploring these different aspects of our
    personality we can develop a deeper understanding of the difference between our
    internal sense of who we are most essentially and the different ways we behave
    in the world."

  Title: How are sub-personalities related to mental health? 
  Image: 
  Description: "Subpersonalities cause difficulties when you identify with one part
    of yourself and believe it to be all of you.\n\nFor example, if you are identified
    with the ‘High achiever’ part of yourself, it may help you to get good grades
    and maintain a motivation for developing your knowledge and feel respected for
    your academic ability. However, if this part of you evolved from wanting love
    and respect from others, you may become over identified with this part of yourself
    and feel very distressed by setbacks or punish yourself for not meeting the expectations
    of others. \n\nYour sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need. By identifying
    these needs you can develop more self awareness and understanding of where this
    part of you came from."

  Title: What are the benefits of sub-personality work? 
  Image: 
  Description: "1. You learn to connect with your different and contradictory ways
    of acting in the world. This raises your awareness of your behaviour and helps
    you to make sense of how you can seem to be different versions of yourself in
    different circumstances.\n\n2. You learn to free yourself of the unconscious forces
    that cause you to get trapped in certain aspects of your personality. \nFor example,
    a very critical part of yourself. \n\n3. You integrate the different aspects of
    your personality which causes you to feel less conflict within yourself.\n\n4.
    You emphasise all of the beneficial qualities of your sub-personalities and recognise
    how they serve you.\n\n5. By identifying with your different sub-peronalities,
    it allows you to develop a greater awareness of what is your true self and what
    is a mask or persona."

  Description: |-
    **Values, Beliefs and Behaviour**

    One of the strongest factors that influence and reflect your sense of identity are the groups that you are a part of in your life.

    From the moment you are born, you are a part of your family group. As you grow and develop, you encounter new groups at school or in our local community. Throughout your whole life, out of choice or out of circumstance, you will spend your times in groups that have an influence on you and which reflect your values, beliefs and mindsets about who you are.

    Groups provide a sense of belonging, which is one of the most important needs in terms of mental health and wellbeing. Research has shown consistently that the quality of your social world is one of the most significant indicators of your wellbeing and ability to recover from difficult times in your life.

At States of Mind, we believe in supporting young people to develop self-knowledge, so they can live in alignment with their most authentic self. Mental health really is a journey not a destination and we believe the best place to start is to explore the journey of your life so far. 

This introductory module explores how we develop and experience our sense of who we are. You will explore different dimensions of your identity and learn how they relate to your personal history and life experiences.

Through guided visualisations, self reflection and group discussions you will gain a deeper understanding of how self awareness can enhance your understanding of who you are.
