  Title: 'Relationships and mental health '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Your behaviour in relationships is driven by your evolutionary needs for safety, love and connection with others.

    Everyone has these needs for love, acceptance and a sense of belonging.

    Your ability to have these needs met in your relationships has a significant impact on your health and mental wellbeing.

  Description: "**Authenticity**\n\nThis means being aware of your own feelings, as
    far as possible, without presenting an outward facade of one attitude, while actually
    holding another attitude at a deeper or unconscious level. \n\n**Acceptance**\n\nThis
    is the sense that we are seen as a person of unconditional self worth and of value,
    no matter what our condition, behaviour or feelings may be.  \n\nIt is only when
    others experience us as we experience ourselves that we can feel free to explore
    all of the different aspects of our inner and often buried experience. "

  Title: 'Attunement in Relationships '
  Image: "/uploads/attunement.jpg"
  Description: "Your relationship with your caregiver/s provides you with your first
    experiences of what relationships are like. Attunement is a shared relational
    experience where we sense that we are witnessed and experienced clearly by others.
    \n\nIf your caregiver/s was present and aware of  your emotional needs and reflected
    back to you a positive sense of self, you will carry a sense of self worth and
    self-esteem into your adult relationships and will feel able to communicate openly
    and honesty about your emotional life."

  Title: 'What shapes our relationships? '
  Image: "/uploads/family.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Your early relationship with your caregivers are one of the biggest influences on how you view relationships and interact with other people in your later life.

    It is common to internalise beliefs that you develop in your early childhood relationships. These may be  positive beliefs of being able to depend on others for support or limiting beliefs such as feeling as if you need to abandon your needs to remain in positive relationships.

    By understanding the different relationship styles and dynamics that you can develop you can become aware of how and where you may you struggle in relationships and learn how to change any behaviours that hold you back.

  Title: 'Neuroplasticity and emotional development. '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Neuroscientists have discovered that your brain is able to continue reshaping itself through your adolescence and adult life. This means that your early emotional and behavioural patterns can change with new experiences that you have throughout your life.

    Your brains ability to reshape itself has significant positive implications for your ability to heal difficult relationship patterns and learn new ways of being with others in relationships.

  Title: The ‘good enough parent’
  Image: "/uploads/Group%20119%20(1).svg"
  Description: "A Psychologist called Donald Winnicott coined this term to refer to
    the fact that no parent can meet your needs all of the time and that no parenting
    style can be completely perfect.\n\nYour parents are individuals with their own
    potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from
    their childhoods.\n\nFor example, your parents may have struggled expressing their
    emotions as a child and feel uncomfortable discussing emotions with you. These
    patterns are passed down through families and can create patterns in how we learn
    to relate emotionally with others. \n\nThis graphic represents how our family
    relationship styles are passed down through generations and how our parents personal
    history of relationships affects our experience as children. "

    This graphic reflects the nature of your emotional development. Your emotional memory from key stages of your life shapes your personal blueprint for how you relate with others as an adult.

    Your childhood needs for authenticity and connection remain with you as you develop and your early experiences are often reflected in how you relate later in life.

    "I find it relatively easy to get close to others and I feel relatively comfortable depending on them and allowing them to depend on me.  I don’t worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me."

    Healthy relationships require that both people are able to present and attuned to the needs of the other and are able to notice how their own emotions impact on the experience of the other person.

  Description: |-
    When there is conflict in healthy relationships, both people are able to repair the rupture by not blaming, withdrawing or attacking the other person but instead seek to identify what has caused the rupture and work collaboratively to find a solution to the underlying issue.

    When conflict arises in healthy relationships, both people can resolve misunderstandings, develop a deeper understanding of the needs of their partner and provide support for the other person, without neglecting their own needs and emotional honesty.

    In healthy relationships, each person will feel that they can rely on the other for emotional support, while respecting each others boundaries and needs.

    in your childhood world, you lived in an environment where you took on care-taking
    roles for the adults around you, or your siblings, you may come to develop a relationship
    pattern where you believe that putting the needs of others before your own is
    more important than communicating your own needs in relationships. "

  Description: "If you have experienced this type of relational environment growing
    up, you are likely to become easily upset and anxious if the other person in the
    relationship withdraws emotionally or physically from you. The reason for this
    is because you have come to believe that your emotional wellbeing is reliant on
    the emotional wellbeing of another person.\n\nYou may become enmeshed in the emotional
    life of our partner, friends or family, instead of prioritising your own emotional
    needs and feeling confident in your ability to express these in your relationships.
    \n\nThis can lead you feeling that you are undeserving of love and attention and
    that other people's needs are more important than your own.\n\nIf you have this
    type of relationship pattern you may find yourself in relationships where you
    feel misunderstood and resentful. You may idealise and put your partner on a pedestal
    or find yourself engaging in manipulative behaviour in an attempt to not lose
    your partners attention and care."

    If you did not experience relationships that were attuned to your needs as a child, you can lose trust in other people’s ability to understand your inner world and come to feel that you must manage your problems alone, without the presence of another person.

  Description: |-
    People with avoidant attachment styles protect themselves against childhood wounding and painful experiences by developing the belief that it is safer to manage feelings alone rather than trust another person to be able to provide them with the soothing and care taking behaviour that they require.

    If you have an avoidant relationships style you may struggle with intimacy in your relationships, as you may struggle to feel able to be vulnerable and honest about your emotional world in the presence of another person.

    If you have an avoidant relationship pattern you may act as if you do not need others when you are feeling vulnerable and become closed off when you experience difficulties in your relationships.

  Title: 'Developing compassion for ourselves '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    If your relationship pattern is causing you to experience unfulfilling relationships or you are struggling to experience closeness in your relationships, self-compassion is an important tool for caring for ourselves and supporting our mental health.

    Without self-compassion you can reinforce limiting beliefs that you are unlovable and incapable of experiencing intimacy and closeness in relationships.

    When you experience conflict or challenges in your relationships it causes your nervous system to react, due to an evolutionary fear of rejection, abandonment and isolation.

    By practicing self compassion you can provide yourself with the need for reassurance and a sense of safety in the absence of another person.

    1. Notice your critical inner narrative

    2. Notice the tension in your body created by your critical thoughts and beliefs

    3. Bring awareness to any areas of tension without resisting them

    4. Breathe softly to these areas of tension to help you release your built up stress and tension

    5. Replace your critical thoughts with supportive and reassuring statements

    # I-Thou relationship

    You see the other person for who they really are, not for what they represent or signify. In this relationships, there is a willingness to understand the other person on a deeper level than your immediate judgements, assumptions and stereotypes that you bring to the relationship.

    # I-It relationship

    You view the other person more as a ‘thing’ than a human being with a story and individual needs. In and I-it relationship you assume you know the other person, without needing to take time to develop a close and mutual relationship with them.

  Title: Splitting
  Image: "/uploads/DTS_Identity_Alex_Tan_3666.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Melanie Klein was a psychologist who focuses on the relationships between parents and children.

    She coined the term ‘splitting’ to describe a psychological defence that young children develop to manage ambivalent feelings towards their parents.

    As a young child you manage difficult feelings in relationships by engaging in a process called ‘splitting’. This process splits your perception of your parents into either a ‘good parent’ or a ‘bad parent’.

    This process causes feelings of either idealisation in relationships or feelings of resentment and an inability to see the other persons good qualities.

    Healthy relationships require that you are aware of this tendency and are able to love another person while experiencing both their positive and more difficult behaviours.

    The attunement that your supportive relationships provide, supports your personal development by reflecting back to you and reinforcing your values, goals, beliefs and worldview.

    Your supportive relationships act as a mirror for you to see yourself authentically.

    These supportive relationships provide a structure of support that ‘hold’ you and builds your sense of confidence and self esteem.

    These relationships can be with members of your community, teachers, family friends, coaches or anybody with whom you have a close healthy relationship.

  Description: |-
    * When you are distressed, distracted or experiencing conflict in our relationships, it affects your capacity to consider that another person’s experience is different to your own.

    * Without open communication, you make guesses and assumptions about what is going on in other person's mind.

    * You assume that other people think in the way that you do.

    * You project your own feelings and past experiences onto other people.

    * You make quick decisions about the meaning of other people’s behaviour without taking time to check it out with them.

    * You do not take time to consider how other people have different experiences than your own.

    * When you are threatened you may hold back your feelings and thoughts about a situation.

    Mentalising is a skill that you use in your everyday lives.

    The term is used to describe your capacity to understand your own mental state and that of other people and how this affects your behaviour.

    Mentalising allows you to notice and reflect on what you are thinking and feeling, aswell as being curious about what may be going on in other people’s minds.

    Mentalising allows you to switch from concrete thought ‘She is behaving like that because’ to a wondering stance ‘ I wonder why she may be behaving like that’.

    your understanding of others\n\nWhen you mentalise other people, they know you

  Title: 'Barriers to good listening '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    # Being distracted by setting:

    If your attention is divided, your ability to listen well will be affected. To remove this barrier, make sure you are in a setting where you will not be interrupted and remove your phone or other distractions within he room.

    # Being distracted by your thoughts:

    When you listen, it is very natural to become distracted and preoccupied by your own personal narrative and reactions to what you are hearing. By becoming aware of when you become lost in your own thoughts you can return to your awareness back to the present moment.

    # Becoming distracted by emotions:

    If the conversation creates an emotional response in you, it can prevent you from being fully present with the speaker.

    # Becoming nervous about silence:

    Silence in conversation can make you feel uncomfortable and awkward. By interrupting to prevent silences you spend a message to the other person that you are not able to contain the feelings of discomfort in the listening process. By taking time to allow silence, or by using silence to summarise back to the listener what you have heard, you can help the listener to feel supported and better understood.

    # Problem solving and giving advice:

    By trying to solve the other person’s problem you can make the other person feel that you are trying to change or fix them, which will often reduce a person’s desire to share their experience.

  Title: 'Empathy '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Empathy is the ability to connect with another person’s feelings and to imagine what it is like to have their point of view.

    Empathy can relate to our ability to connect with both the positive and uncomfortable emotions of others.

    Practising empathy in relationships changes the way you speak and listen to others and promotes deeper levels of connection and understanding.

  Title: 'Empathic Listening and Bifocal vision '
  Image: 
  Description: "Empathic listening is a type of listening that involves tuning into
    the emotional message that a person is communicating. \n\nThis type of listening
    helps people to understand their emotions better, builds trust and helps both
    the speaker and listener to develop their emotional intelligence.\n  \nBy feeding
    back both the verbal message and the emotional message that you are hearing from
    the speaker, you allow them to feel seen and understood on a deeper level. "

  Title: 'Conflict, rupture and repair  '
  Image: 
  Description: "**Wounding in relationships.**\n\nWounding occurs in relationships
    when there has been conflict or emotional neglect that has been left unresolved
    in the relationship. The emotional impact of the wounding causes the person to
    behave in ways that protect them from further harm. \n\n**What happens in the
    brain when we experience ruptures in our relationships?**\n\nResearch has shown
    that when you experience conflict and rupture in our relationships, the same areas
    of your brain light up as those that are activated when you break a leg or experience
    physical pain.  \n\n\n"

    in relationships are:**\n\n* Avoiding contact with the person who has caused the
    wounding and withdrawing attention and communication. \n* Acting out and harming
    the other person out of fear and desperation. This could take the form of abusive
    text messages, manipulation and blackmail or physical and verbal abuse. \n* Becoming
    hypervigilant to the actions of the other person and other relationships. \n"

  Description: "Hypervigilance is caused by an overactive nervous response to emotional
    harm and wounding. \n\nHypervigilance may look like: \n\nStalking, constantly
    checking your phone to see if the other person has messaged you or become preoccupied
    with thoughts about the other person and ruminating about the issue, without seeking
    to resolve it or repair the issue in their presence.  "

  Title: 'Creating a safe space for resolving conflict '
  Image: 
  Description: "In healthy relationships, each person feels seen and understood for
    their true nature and is able to act and communicate from this place. \n\nProblems
    are addressed as they arise in relationships, without the person harbouring resentment
    or communicating in unclear ways about the nature of the problem. \n\nWhen the
    person is upset and emotionally struggling, the partner makes space to understand
    and listen to them, without minimising or punishing you for experiencing the emotions.  \n\nProblems
    are seen as opportunities for growth, not personal attacks or opportunities to
    play a blame game. People who are secure in their relationships, do not take criticism
    as a reason to blame the other, but are open to listening to the feedback about
    how they make others feel. \n"

  Title: 'Boundaries '
  Image: 
  Description: "Setting boundaries is a tool that is important in all of your relationships.
    \n\nIf you did not learn to set boundaries in childhood, it is important to do
    so in adulthood, so that you can clearly express your feelings and needs. Setting
    healthy boundaries helps you to communicate what types of behaviour you will/
    will not tolerate from others by stating what is and is not acceptable to you.
    \n\nBy setting boundaries you can improve your self esteem and prevent difficult
    feelings of resentment, anger and stress from emerging in your relationships.\n\nWhen
    healthy boundaries are present, each person understands that they are responsible
    for advocating for their own needs in relationships and communicating clearly
    so that other people understand what they need."

    communicating the boundary to other friends or family before setting the boundary

    firmly, clearly and respectfully. \n\nDo not justify or apologise for the boundary
    you are setting. \n\nRemember that you are not responsible for the feelings for
    the person you are setting the boundary with, your only responsibly is to assert
    the boundary in a respectful way. "

  Title: Why is it difficult to leave unhealthy relationships?  
  Image: 
  Description: "Even if you know your relationships are unfitlfilling and not meeting
    our needs, it can feel  difficult to move forward and take the initiative to end
    the relationship. \n\nThe feelings of pain and detachment are extremely strong
    feelings that motivate you to maintain the relationship at all costs. \n\nIt is
    actually painful emotions that can keep you in unhealthy relationships, not just
    the positive ones. \n\nOnce our painful feelings of abandonment and low self esteem
    are activated, you become focused on reconnecting with the person and often trick
    ourselves into believing that each time you reconnect, you will get our needs
    met the next time, causing repeating cycles of rupture, repair and further rupture
    when you realise that the problems still exist but you feel powerless to change
    them.\n\nThis causes you to feel even more hopeless and even less able to solve
    problems in your relationships and get your needs met. \n\nThis belief can cause
    you to develop the perception that no relationship will meet your needs because
    you internalise the experience and blame yourself for the feelings of isolation
    and neglect. \n\n"

    Recognise that ending a relationship will bring up emotions for both people involved
    in the ending and creating space for both people’s experiences to be heard and
    respected is crucial for both people to feel acknowledged in the ending. \n\n3.Be
    emotionally honest about the reasons for wanting to end the relationship. Being
    emotionally honest does not involve blaming or criticising the other person but
    describing your personal feelings using ‘I’ statements not ‘You’ statements. \n\n4.
    Do not send mixed messages but be clear about your reasons for wanting to end
    the relationship.  \n\n5. Support yourself by surrounding yourself with close
    and trusted friends who can help you express and process any difficult feelings
    you experience after ending an unhealthy relationship. "

Our relationships shape our understanding of ourselves and the world in which we live. The bonds we make and the bonds that break are one of the most influential factors affecting our sense of wellbeing in our everyday lives.

This module will explore how our early relationships shape our ability to experience closeness and intimacy with others and influence our ability to express our needs and authentic experience with those around us.

You will explore the significant relationships in your life and the meaning they have for you. You will develop skills that can enhance the quality of your relationships and help you develop deeper and more meaningful bonds in your everyday life.
