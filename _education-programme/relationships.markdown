  Title: 'Relationships and mental health '
  Image: 
  Description: "Our behaviour in relationships is driven by our evolutionary needs
    for safety, love and connection with others.\n\nEveryone has these needs for love,
    connection and a sense of belonging and these core needs are what drive our behaviour
    in relationships and how we interact with others. \n\nOur ability to have these
    needs met in our relationships has a significant impact on our health and mental
    wellbeing."

  Title: 'Attunement in Relationships '
  Image: "/uploads/attunement.jpg"
  Description: "Our relationship with our family provides us with our first experiences
    of what relationships are like. \n\nThe way that our parent/s responded to our
    needs for authenticity and connection in childhood shapes our understanding of
    whether we can trust others to meet these needs .\n\nIf our family was present
    and attuned to what we needed and reflected back to us a positive sense of self,
    we will carry a sense of self worth and self-esteem into our adult relationships
    and will feel able to communicate openly and honesty about our emotional life.\n\nThis
    process of reflecting back our authentic self is called ‘attunement’."

  Title: 'Authenticity and Connection '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    While as individuals we can work to meet these needs for ourselves, we can also supporting each other to meet these needs so that our relationships feel healthy and fulfilling.

    **Authenticity**

    One of our core needs is the ability to feel like we can bring our full self to our relationships.

    **Connection**

    We all have a need to feel like we are seen, understood and valued in our relationships.

  Title: 'What influences our personal relationships? '
  Image: "/uploads/family.jpg"
  Description: "Our early relationship with our parents are one of the biggest influences
    on how we view relationships and interact with others in our later life.\n\nIt
    is common to internalise beliefs that we developed in our early childhood relationships,
    such as positive beliefs of being able to depend on others for support or limiting
    beliefs such as feeling as if we need to abandon our needs to remain in a positive
    relationship with others.\n\nBy understanding the different relationship styles
    and dynamics that we can develop we can become aware of how and why we struggle
    in relationships and learn how to change any behaviours that hold us back. "

  Title: The ‘good enough parent’
  Image: 
  Description: "A Psychologist called Donald Winnicott coined this term to refer to
    the fact that no parent can meet our needs all of the time and that no parenting
    style can be completely perfect.\n\nOur parents are individuals with their own
    potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from
    their childhoods. \n\nIf our parents punished us or were unavailable when we needed
    them emotionally, we may come to develop a belief that it is unsafe or uncomfortable
    expressing our needs with others as adults. This ‘non-attunement’ can have a significant
    impact on our sense of self worth, our ability to regulate our emotions and our
    mental health.\n\nAlthough no parent can meet all of our needs all of the time,
    the amount of attunement that they were able to provide has been shown to influence
    the quality of our relationships as an adult."

    This graphic reflects the nature of our emotional development. Our emotional memory from key stages of our life shapes our personal blueprint for how we relate with others as adults.


    Our childhood needs for authenticity and connection remain with us as we develop and our early experiences are often reflected in how we relate in our adult lives.

    "I find it relatively easy to get close to others and I feel relatively comfortable depending on them and allowing them to depend on me.  I don’t worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me."

    Healthy relationships require that both people are able to present and attuned to the needs of the other and are able to notice how their own emotions impact on the experience of the other person.

  Description: |-
    When there is conflict in healthy relationships, both people are able to repair the rupture by not blaming, withdrawing or attacking the other person but instead seek to identify what has caused the rupture and work collaboratively to find a solution to the underlying issue.

    When conflict arises in healthy relationships, both people can resolve misunderstandings, develop a deeper understanding of the needs of their partner and provide support for the other person, without neglecting their own needs and emotional honesty.

    In healthy relationships, each person will feel that they can rely on the other for emotional support, while respecting each others boundaries and needs.

    I often worry that my partner doesn’t love me or won’t want to stay with me. I

    in our childhood world, we lived in an environment where we took on care-taking
    roles for the adults around us, or our siblings, we may come to develop a relationship
    pattern where we believe that putting the needs of others before our own is more
    important than communicating our own needs in relationships. "

  Title:

  Description: "If we have experienced this type of relational environment growing
    up, we are likely to become easily upset and anxious if the other person in the
    relationship withdraws emotionally or physically from us. The reason for this
    is because we have come to believe that our emotional wellbeing is reliant on
    the emotional wellbeing of another person.\n\nWe may become enmeshed in the emotional
    life of our partner, friends or family, instead of prioritising our own emotional
    needs and feeling confident in our ability to express these in our relationships.
    \n\nThis can lead to a feeling in our relationships, that we are undeserving of
    love and attention and that our partner’s needs are more important than ours.\n\nPeople
    who have experienced this type of relationship pattern may find themselves in
    relationships where they feel misunderstood and resentful. They may idealise and
    put their partner on a pedestal or find themselves engaging in manipulative behaviour
    in an attempt to not lose their partners attention and care."

    If we do not experience relationships that were attuned to our needs as children, we can lose trust in other people’s ability to understand our inner world and come to feel that we must manage our problems alone, without the presence of another.

  Image: 
  Description: |-
    People with avoidant attachment styles protect themselves against childhood wounding and painful experiences by developing the belief that it is safer to manage feelings alone rather than trust another person to be able to provide them with the soothing and care taking behaviour that they require.

    People with avoidant relationships styles may struggle with intimacy in relationships, as they may struggle to feel able to be vulnerable and honest about their emotional world in the presence of another person.

    People with avoidant relationship patterns often act as if they do not need others when they are feeling vulnerable and become closed off when they experience difficulties in relationships.

  Title: 'Neuroplasticity and emotional development. '
  Image: "/uploads/neuroplasticity%202-55627e.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Neuroscientists have discovered that the brain is able to continue reshaping itself through our adolescence and adult life. This means that early emotional and behavioural patterns can change with new experiences that we have throughout our lives.


    Often, we will repeat similar patterns in our relationships due to the way our early childhood experiences shape our perception of the present day, yet our relationships in adult life can also reshape our perception of what relationships can be like.


    The brains ability to reshape itself has significant positive implications for our understanding of how people can heal difficult relationship patterns, learning new skills and develop new beliefs about their ability to experience intimacy and connection with others.

  Title: Compassion
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Compassion is the foundation for empathy, love and compromise in relationships.

    Compassion is an attitude and belief in equality and each persons right to be valued and understood.

    When we do not judge or criticise the behaviour of another person but take time to understand and work through problems together, we show the other person that we do not see problems in the relationship as Indications of their worth. Instead, we see working through problems  as an opportunity for growth that can provide deeper levels of understanding and connection.

    By respecting another person as having the same needs for love, connection and understanding as ourselves, we can overcome the judgement and limiting beliefs about others that can cause distance and misunderstanding in relationships.

  Title: 'Relationships with self '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    ‘Fear of compassion for self and compassion from others were also significantly linked to fear of compassion for others.’ 

    Paul Gilbert is an evolutionary psychologist who explored the link between self compassion and the quality of our relationships. Gilbert found that people who struggled to feel care and compassion for themselves found it more difficult to relate with compassion for others.

    Gilberts work highlights how our relationship with ourselves has a real and lasting influence on our ability to form close and caring relationships with the people in our lives.

  Title: 'Developing compassion for ourselves '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    If our relationship pattern is causing us to experience unfulfilling relationships or we are struggling to experience closeness in our relationships, self-compassion is an important tool for caring for ourselves and supporting our mental health.

     Without self-compassion we can reinforce limiting beliefs that we are unlovable and incapable of experiencing intimacy and closeness in relationships.

    When we experience conflict or challenges in our relationships it causes our nervous systems to react, due to an evolutionary fear of rejection, abandonment and isolation.

  Title: 'Self Compassion '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    By practicing self compassion we can provide ourselves with the need for reassurance and a sense of safety in the absence of another person.

    1. Notice the critical inner narrative

    2. Notice the tension in your body created by these critical thoughts and beliefs

    3. Bring awareness to the areas of tension without resisting them

    4. Breathe softly to these areas of tension to help release the built up stress and tension

    5. Replace critical thoughts with supportive and reassuring statements

    He explored different ways that people perceived and acted towards other people in their relationships.

     He called these different ways of viewing others in relationship as ‘I-Thou’ and ‘I-it’ relationships.

    # I-Thou relationship

     The other person is seen for who they really are, not for what they represent or signify. In this relationships, there is a willingness to understand the other person on a deeper level than our immediate judgements, assumptions and stereotypes that we bring to the relationship.

    # I-It relationship

    We view the other person more as a ‘thing’ than a human being with a story and individual needs. In and I-it relationship we assume we know the other person, without needing to take time to develop a close and mutual relationship with them.

    The attunement that our supportive relationships provide, supports our personal development by reflecting back to us and reinforcing our values, goals, beliefs and worldview.

    Our supportive relationships act as a mirror for us to see ourselves authentically.

    These supportive relationships provide a structure of support that ‘hold’ us and support our sense of confidence and self esteem.

    These relationships can be with members of our community, teachers, family friends, coaches or anybody with whom we have a close healthy relationship.

  Title: Splitting
  Image: "/uploads/DTS_Identity_Alex_Tan_3666.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Melanie Klein was a psychologist who focuses on the relationships between parents and children.

     She coined the term ‘splitting’ to describe a psychological defence that young children develop to manage ambivalent feelings towards their parents.

    As young children we manage difficult feelings in relationships by engaging in a process called ‘splitting’. This process splits our perception of our parents into either a ‘good parent’ or a ‘bad parent’.

    This process causes feelings of either idealisation in relationships or feelings of resentment and an inability to see the other persons good qualities.

    Healthy relationships require that we are aware of this tendency and are able to love another person while experiencing both their positive and more difficult behaviours.

  Title: 'Why do we misunderstand other people? '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    * When we are distressed, distracted or experiencing conflict in our relationships, it affects our capacity to consider that another person’s experience is different to our own.

    * Without open communication, we make guesses and assumptions about what is going on in other people’s minds.

    * We assume that other people think in the way that we do.

    * We project our own feelings and past experiences onto other people.

    * We make quick decisions about the meaning of other people’s behaviour without taking time to check it out with them.

    * We do not take time to consider how other people have different experiences than our own.

    * When people are threatened they may hold back their feelings and thoughts about a situation.

  Description: |-
    Mentalising is a skill that we all use in our everyday lives.

    The term is used to describe our capacity to understand our own mental state and that of other people and how this affects our behaviour.

    Mentalising allows us to think consciously about what we are thinking and feeling, aswell as being curious about what may be going on in other people’s minds.

    Mentalising allows us to switch from concrete thought ‘ She is behaving like that because’ to a wondering stance ‘ I wonder why she may be behaving like that’.

  Description: |-
    People who are skilled at mentalising are considerably **more resilient** when faced with stressful situations and are able to self reflect and process experiences of adversity in their lives with more coherence and understanding.

    They are more able to **make sense of both the external world and their internal world** of thoughts, feelings and emotions.

    They have an **increased ability for creative thought**, the ability to hold multiple perspectives and are generally more capable of connecting with the inner lives of other people.

    # Being distracted by our thoughts:

    When we listen, it is very natural to become distracted and preoccupied by our own personal narrative and reactions to what we are hearing. By becoming aware of becoming lost in our own thoughts we can return to good listening.

    # Becoming distracted by emotions.

    If the conversation creates an emotional response in us, it can prevent us from being fully present to the speaker.

    # Becoming nervous about silence.

    Silence in conversation can make us feel uncomfortable and awkward . By interrupting to prevent silences we spend a message to the other person that we are not able to contain the feelings of discomfort in the listening process. By taking time to allow silence, or by using silence to summarise back to the listener what you have heard, you can help the listener to feel supported and better understood.

    # Problem solving and giving advice:

    By trying to solve the other person’s problem we can make the other person feel that we are trying to change or fix them, which will often reduce a person’s desire to share their experience.

  Title: 'Empathy '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Empathy is the ability to connect with another person’s feelings and to imagine what it is like to have their point of view.

    Empathy can relate to our ability to connect with both the positive and uncomfortable emotions of others.

    Practising empathy in relationships changes the way we speak and listen to others and promotes deeper levels of connection and understanding.

  Title: 'Empathic Listening and Bifocal vision '
  Image: 
  Description: "Empathic listening is a type of listening that involves tuning into
    the emotional message that a person is communicating. \nEmpathic listening helps
    people to understand their emotions better, builds trust and helps both the speaker
    and listener to develop emotional intelligence.  \nBifocal vision is a way to
    provide feedback about another person’s non-verbal communication and listen to
    the deeper message they are communicating. \nFor example, if somebody is telling
    us that they have had a good week but their tone of voice is low, bifocal vision
    allows us to pick up on this mis-match between what the person is saying and the
    emotional message they are giving to us. \nBy feeding back both the verbal message
    and the emotional message that we are hearing from the speaker, we allow them
    to feel seen and understood on a deeper level. "

  Title: 'Conflict , rupture and repair  '
  Image: 
  Description: "What happens in the brain when we experience ruptures in our relationships? \n\nResearch
    has shown that when we experience conflict and rupture in our relationships, the
    same areas of our brain light up as those that are activated when we break a leg
    or experience physical pain.  \n\nWounding in relationships \n\nWounding occurs
    in relationships when there has been conflict or emotional neglect that has been
    left unresolved in the relationship. The emotional impact of the wounding causes
    the person to behave in ways that protect them from further harm. \n\nSome examples
    of patterns of behaviour that emerge from wounding in relationships are:\n\nAvoiding
    contact with the person who has caused the wounding and withdrawing attention
    and communication. \n\nActing out and harming the other person out of fear and
    desperation. This could take the form of abusive text messages, manipulation and
    blackmail or physical and verbal abuse. \n\nBecoming hypervigilant to the actions
    of the other person and other relationships. Hypervigilance is caused by an overactive
    nervous response to emotional harm and wounding. Hypervigilance may look like
    stalking, constantly checking your phone to see if the other person has messaged
    you or become preoccupied with thoughts about the other person and ruminating
    about the issue , without seeking to resolve it or repair the issue in their presence.  "

  Title: 'Creating a safe space for resolving conflict '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    In healthy relationships, each person feels seen and understood for their true nature and is able to act and communicate from this place. This way of being with each other is what the Psychologist Bowlby called a secure base. How can you provide and recognise a secure base in relationships? 

    Problems are addressed as they arise in relationships, without the person harbouring resentment or communicating in unclear ways about the nature of the problem. 

    When the person is upset and emotionally struggling, the partner makes space to understand and listen to them, without minimising or punishing you for experiencing the emotions.  

    Problems are seen as opportunities for growth, not personal attacks or opportunities to play a blame game. People who are secure in their relationships, do not take criticism as a reason to blame the other, but are open to listening to the issue and adapting their behaviour to better meet the needs of their partner. 

    Problems are seen as opportunities to create growth and understanding in the relationship. By learning about what is causing the problems, the partner is better able to understand the needs of the other person and what they need to feel safe and secure, instead of misunderstood and anxious.

  Title: 'Boundaries '
  Image: 
  Description: "Setting boundaries is a tool that is important in all of our relationships.
    \nIf we did not learn to set boundaries in childhood, it is important to do so
    in adulthood, so that we can clearly express our feelings and needs. Setting healthy
    boundaries helps us to communicate what types of behaviour we will/ will not tolerate
    from others by stating what is and is not acceptable to you. \nBy setting boundaries
    we can improve our self esteem and prevent difficult feelings of resentment, anger
    and stress from emerging in our relationships.\nHealthy boundaries are flexible
    and an essential part of healthy relationships where each person respects the
    boundaries of the other. \nWhen healthy boundaries are present, each person understands
    that they are responsible for advocating for their own needs in relationships
    and communicating clearly so that they can get their needs met."

    calmly, firmly, clearly and respectfully. \nDo not justify or apologise for the
    boundary you are setting. \nRemember that you are not responsible for the feelings
    for the person you are setting the boundary with, your only responsibly is to
    assert the boundary in a respectful way. "

  Title: Why is it difficult to leave unhealthy relationships?  
  Image: 
  Description: "\n\nEven if we know our relationships are unfitlfilling and not meeting
    our needs, it can feel  difficult to move forward and take the initiative to end
    the relationship. The feelings of pain and detachment are extremely strong feelings
    that motivate us to maintain the relationship at all costs. It is actually painful
    emotions that can keep us in unhealthy relationships, not just the positive ones.
    \n\nOnce our painful feelings of abandonment and low self esteem are activated,
    we become focused on reconnecting with the person and often trick ourselves into
    believing that each time we reconnect, we will get our needs met the next time,
    causing repeating cycles of rupture, repair and further rupture when we realise
    that the problems still exist but we feel powerless to change them.\n\nThis causes
    us to feel even more hopeless and even less able to solve problems in our relationships
    and get our needs met. This belief can cause us to develop the belief that no
    relationship will meet our needs because we internalise the experience and blame
    ourselves for the feelings of isolation and neglect. \n\nThe fear of being alone
    and unloved causes us to maintain relationships that are only partially able to
    meet our needs and we end up feeling unfulfilled and distressed. "

  Title: 'Ending relationships. '
  Image: 
  Description: "Relationships come to an end for many reasons. They may end out of
    personal choice or for reasons outside of our control. Ending relationships can
    be difficult if we feel a sense of loyalty for the other person or if we have
    been avoiding ending the relationship out of fear of the consequences.  \nConsciously
    ending a relationship in a healthy way is a skill that we can develop which can
    have benefits for our emotional wellbeing.   \n1. Recognise that if a relationship
    is not feeling right for you, it will not be an appropriate relationship for the
    other person either. \n2. Recognise that ending a relationship will bring up emotions
    for both people involved in the ending and creating space for both people’s experiences
    to be heard and respected is crucial for both people to feel acknowledged in the
    ending. \n3.Be emotionally honest about the reasons for wanting to end the relationship.
    Being emotionally honest does not involve blaming or criticising the other person
    but describing your personal feelings using ‘I’ statements not ‘You’ statements.
    \n4. Do not send mixed messages but be clear about your reasons for wanting to
    end the relationship. "
