  Title: What is depression?
  Image: 
  Description: "Depression is an experience that is manifests in our mental, emotional
    and physical experience. \n\nIt is characterised by an intense preoccupation with
    negative thinking about our past, current and future self. \n\nThese ways of thinking
    are accompanied by an emotional experience of meaninglessness and ‘apathy’, which
    is the loss of interest or pleasure in life.\n\nPeople experiencing depression
    also experience changes to their physical state, such as increased tiredness and
    fatigue and difficulty concentrating. "

  Title: "‘ The chemical imbalance theory’"
  Description: "\nFor a long time, psychiatrists believed that depression was caused
    by a lack of serotonin and dopamine in the brain as these are brain chemicals
    that are related to our mood and sense of motivation and enjoyment in life. So
    far, no research has been able to identify a causal relationship between neurochemistry
    and depression. Some people who have high levels of serotonin can experience chronic
    depression, as well as people with low levels. \n\nThe difficulty with identifying
    a single biological cause for depression is that there are many factors that contribute
    to our neurochemistry, such as the amount of exercise we do, the food we eat and
    the types of social environments that we live in. "

  Title: Research on the effectiveness of medical approaches to depression
  Description: "65 - 80% of people remain feeling depressed after one year of taking
    antidepressant medications. (1)\n\nA new study, published in the Journal of Affective
    Disorders in 2020, found that patients who believe that a chemical imbalance in
    the brain causes depression had worse treatment outcomes and a greater presence
    of depressive symptoms at the end of the study.  \n\n“Our findings are in line
    with accumulating evidence that some biogenetic beliefs, like the chemical imbalance
    belief, are linked with poorer expectations for improvement, especially among
    those with the most troubling symptoms.”\n\nResearch suggests that people who
    view their emotional distress as the result of chemical imbalances in the brain
    may feel less hopeful and less in control throughout the recovery process. (2) "

  Description: "* Antidepressants have failed to provide an effective remedy for cases
    of depression in the western world.  \n\nSSRIs and other antidepressants prescription
    has increased from less than 10 million in 1991 to almost 40 million in 2009.\n\nThese
    levels of prescribing have not been associated with a reduction in the related
    burden of care, with the number of people claiming incapacity benefit for a mental
    or behavioural disorder rising steadily from under 750 000 in 2000 to nearly a
    million in 2008.\n"

  Description: "* Although it is often stated with great confidence that depressed
    people have a serotonin or norepinephrine deficiency, the evidence actually contradicts
    these claims.”  \n* Professor Emeritus of Neuroscience Elliot Valenstein, in ‘Blaming
    the Brain’ ( 1998) which reviews the evidence for the serotonin hypothesis. \n*
    ‘ No abnormality of serotonin in depression has ever been demonstrated’ \n* Psychiatrist
    David Healey, Psychiatrist, Former secretary for the British Association of Psychopharmacology.\n\n“Patients
    have been diagnosed with ‘chemical imbalances’ despite the fact that no test exists
    to support such a claim, and there is no real conception of what a correct chemical
    imbalance would look like…”"

  Description: "A Meta-analysis ( analysis of a large group of research studies) has
    shown that\n\n“unmedicated patients have much shorter episodes, and better long-term
    prospects, than medicated patients. Several of these studies have found that the
    average duration of an untreated episode of major depression is 12–13 weeks.” "

    ‘Fright’. \n* This is a state of intense distress that is triggered when intense
    fear combines with a sense of being trapped or constrained. (Schauer & Elbert,
    2010) \n* If somebody is not able to release energy by escaping or defending themselves
    from a situation that is highly distressing, the body begins to shut down.  "
