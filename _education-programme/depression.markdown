  Title: What is depression?
  Image: 
  Description: "Depression is an experience that is manifests in our mental, emotional
    and physical experience. It is characterised by an intense preoccupation with
    negative thinking about our past, current and future self. These ways of thinking
    are accompanied by an emotional experience of meaninglessness and ‘apathy’, which
    is the loss of interest or pleasure in life. \nPeople experiencing depression
    also experience changes to their physical state, such as increased tiredness and
    fatigue and difficulty concentrating. "

  Title: "‘The chemical imbalance theory’"
  Description: "For a long time, psychiatrists believed that depression was caused
    by a lack of serotonin and dopamine in the brain as these are brain chemicals
    that are related to our mood and sense of motivation and enjoyment in life. \n\nSo
    far, no research has been able to identify a causal relationship between neurochemistry
    and depression. Some people who have high levels of serotonin can experience chronic
    depression, as well as people with low levels. \n\nThe difficulty with identifying
    a single biological cause for depression is that there are many factors that contribute
    to our neurochemistry, such as the amount of exercise we do, the food we eat and
    the types of social environments that we live in. "

  Title: Research on the effectiveness of medical approaches to depression
  Description: "65 - 80% of people remain feeling depressed after one year of taking
    antidepressant medications. (1)\n\nA new study, published in the Journal of Affective
    Disorders in 2020, found that patients who believe that a chemical imbalance in
    the brain causes depression had worse treatment outcomes and a greater presence
    of depressive symptoms at the end of the study.  \n\n“Our findings are in line
    with accumulating evidence that some biogenetic beliefs, like the chemical imbalance
    belief, are linked with poorer expectations for improvement, especially among
    those with the most troubling symptoms.”"

    the result of chemical imbalances in the brain may feel less hopeful and less
    in control throughout the recovery process. (2) \n\n* Antidepressants have failed
    to provide an effective remedy for cases of depression in the western world.  \n\n*
    SSRIs and other antidepressants prescription has increased from less than 10 million
    in 1991 to almost 40 million in 2009.\n\nThese levels of prescribing have not
    been associated with a reduction in the related burden of care, with the number
    of people claiming incapacity benefit for a mental or behavioural disorder rising

    * In her article ‘ Traumatic Immobility, Depression and the Stress Response, Sarah Knutson compared her own experience of depression with the final 3 stages of the stress response:

    1. Felt constantly threatened (repeated job loss, poverty, homelessness, out of sync with mainstream & workplace values, relationship failure, social pariah): low mood, worry, mental and physical activation, weird appetite and sleep

    2.  Felt out of options (low physical, material and social resources; tired all the time, brain not functioning): hopelessness, sadness, despair, indecision

    3. Gas pedal/sympathetic (constant pressure to do something to fix it): worry, activation, insomnia, eating for energy

    4. Brake/parasympathetic (no clue how to fix it, where to turn or if it would ever get better): Low energy, low mood, low appetite and low interest in life; digestive troubles, stomach cramps, poor thinking and concentration; leaden limbs, sleeping a lot

    5. Life indefinitely stalled by Brake (wasting my life, leaving a legacy of suffering and pain, letting myself and others down): Worthlessness, emptiness, guilt, indecision, crying a lot, preoccupied with death and suicide

    \n\nFamily therapy allows members of a family, couples or other groups of people
    who care about each other to work through their difficult experiences safely in
    the presence of a therapist. The therapy focuses on supportive people to value
    their own and each others needs and explore their problems collaboratively. \n\n\nOne study compared
    systemic family therapy with psychodynamic therapy for depression and found that
    both groups improved significantly. \n\nAfter 6-months, 100% of the children in
    psychodynamic therapy and 81% in family therapy no longer met criteria for depression.
    \n\nBoth groups saw the same dramatic increase in the child’s overall functioning.
    \n\nNone of the participants in either group experienced returning depressive
    symptoms over the 6-month period. "

  Description: "* People who experience depression often feel confused, guilty and
    shameful around the experience of not meeting the expectations of themselves and
    others. \n* The resistance to feeling the painful emotional states is one of the
    factors that causes depression to perpetuate. \n* Our close relationships can
    provide us with a safe space to express painful emotions and bring awareness and
    acceptance to our experience of depression. "

    What is Unconditional Positive Regard? 


    Unconditional Positive Regard is a term coined by Carl Rogers, who developed person centred-therapy a method where the person seeking therapy was seen as central to the direction of the therapeutic work and held as the expert of their own experience. Rogers used the term to describe the complete and loving acceptance of another person.  

    ‘ True empathy is always free of any evaluative or diagnostic quality’

  Title: 'Why is unconditional  positive regard beneficial for depression? '
  Description: |-
    People who are experiencing depression often hold an underlying belief that they are not loveable, are flawed and not worthy of love & acceptance.  

    Why is unconditional positive regard important when people are experiencing depression? 


    By showing unconditional positive regard it allows others to open up about negative beliefs and parts of themselves they feel ashamed of. 

    Unconditional positive regard removes any judgement or evaluation of others and allows others to feel that they are able to be accepted for who they are, without needing to change.

  Title: 'Behavioural activation '
  Description: "The idea behind behavioural activation is to gradually change small
    aspects of how we live, so that we can slowly change our experience of ourselves
    in our everyday lives and explore what changes positively affect your mood and
    wellbeing. \n\nBehaviour Activation works by increasing the amount of rewarding
    activities in your life. By changing habits and behaviours it creates new pathways
    in the brain that reinforce behaviour change. \n\nPast research has proven  that
    BA is effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms. "

  Title: 'Tips for behavioural activation '
  Description: "Don’t chose what you think you should do, chose something that you
    personally enjoy and want to do. Imagine a positive life that you want to have,
    what sorts of activities and things are you doing? The aim is to allow yourself
    to feel joy, contentment and other positive and reassuring feelings through the
    activities in your everyday life. \n\nStart small and make it measurable. Chose
    something small. This could be anything from\n\n‘ I want to make my bed every
    morning’ to\n‘ I want to go to a life drawing class this week.’ \n\nAsk others
    to help you. By asking for the support of your friends it will help reinforce
    your goals and will also mean that you can share the experience with somebody
    else. Ask if they can help you build it into your routine.\n\nRecording your progress
    will provide more of a sense of control. Once every few weeks reflect on how things
    have changes and what difference these changes, no matter how small, have made
    on your mood."

  Title: 'Finding a balance '
  Description: "Ultimately, our mood is influenced by many aspects of our lives. It
    is natural and normal to feel uncomfortable emotions and to be triggered by difficult
    events in our lives. \n\nSometimes we may spend longer periods of time feeling
    low and powerless over how we experience life. \n\nOvercoming depression involves
    developing an understanding of the areas of our lives that are not serving us,
    or that are out of balance, so that we can support ourselves to find new ways
    of experiencing self care, meaning and purpose in our lives.  "
