  Title: What is depression?
  Image: 
  Description: "Depression is an experience that is manifests in our mental, emotional
    and physical experience. \n\nIt is characterised by an intense preoccupation with
    negative thinking about our past, current and future self. \n\nThese ways of thinking
    are accompanied by an emotional experience of meaninglessness and ‘apathy’, which
    is the loss of interest or pleasure in life.\n\nPeople experiencing depression
    also experience changes to their physical state, such as increased tiredness and
    fatigue and difficulty concentrating. "

  Title: "‘ The chemical imbalance theory’"
  Description: "\nFor a long time, psychiatrists believed that depression was caused
    by a lack of serotonin and dopamine in the brain as these are brain chemicals
    that are related to our mood and sense of motivation and enjoyment in life. So
    far, no research has been able to identify a causal relationship between neurochemistry
    and depression. Some people who have high levels of serotonin can experience chronic
    depression, as well as people with low levels. \n\nThe difficulty with identifying
    a single biological cause for depression is that there are many factors that contribute
    to our neurochemistry, such as the amount of exercise we do, the food we eat and
    the types of social environments that we live in. "

  Title: Research on the effectiveness of medical approaches to depression
  Description: "65 - 80% of people remain feeling depressed after one year of taking
    antidepressant medications. (1)\n\nA new study, published in the Journal of Affective
    Disorders in 2020, found that patients who believe that a chemical imbalance in
    the brain causes depression had worse treatment outcomes and a greater presence
    of depressive symptoms at the end of the study.  \n\n“Our findings are in line
    with accumulating evidence that some biogenetic beliefs, like the chemical imbalance
    belief, are linked with poorer expectations for improvement, especially among
    those with the most troubling symptoms.”\n\nResearch suggests that people who
    view their emotional distress as the result of chemical imbalances in the brain
    may feel less hopeful and less in control throughout the recovery process. (2) "
