  Title: "‘The chemical imbalance theory’"
  Description: "For a long time, psychiatrists believed that depression was caused
    by a lack of serotonin and dopamine in the brain as these are brain chemicals
    that are related to our mood and sense of motivation and enjoyment in life. \n\nSo
    far, no research has been able to identify a causal relationship between neurochemistry
    and depression. Some people who have high levels of serotonin can experience chronic
    depression, as well as people with low levels. \n"

    the number of people claiming incapacity benefit for a mental health problem rising
    steadily from under 750 000 in 2000 to nearly a million in 2008.\n\n65 - 80% of

  Title: 'Fight, Flight and “Fright” '
  Description: "* Researchers have described a stage of the stress response called
    ‘Fright’. \n\n* This is a state of intense distress that is triggered when intense
    fear combines with a sense of being trapped or constrained. \n\n* If somebody
    is not able to release energy by escaping or defending themselves from a situation
    that is highly distressing, the body begins to shut down and our mind and body
    become 'immobile'.  \n\nTonic immobility (fright) is almost always displayed when
    the person is overwhelmed by threat and not allowed and not able to act aggressively
    ( defend themselves) against the threat."

    * In her article ‘ Traumatic Immobility, Depression and the Stress Response, Sarah Knutson compared her own experience of depression with the final 3 stages of the stress response:

    1. Felt constantly threatened (repeated job loss, poverty, homelessness, out of sync with mainstream & workplace values, relationship failure): low mood, worry, mental and physical activation, weird appetite and sleep

    2.  Felt out of options (low physical, material and social resources; tired all the time, brain not functioning): hopelessness, sadness, despair, indecision

    3. Gas pedal/sympathetic (constant pressure to do something to fix it): worry, activation, insomnia, eating for energy

    5. Life indefinitely stalled by Brake (wasting my life, leaving a legacy of suffering and pain, letting myself and others down): Worthlessness, emptiness, guilt, indecision, crying a lot, preoccupied with death and suicide

  Description: "Social exclusion and rejection can cause experiences of physical numbness
    and a lack of emotion. \n\nResearchers who studied people who had been excluded
    from a society or group found that it was common for them to shut down their emotional
    response rather than experiencing heightened states of distress.\n\n“It was as
    though they had been hit with a stun gun”\n\nThey suggest could be an adaptive
    response to prevent retaliation against the group and to keep painful emotions
    out of awareness."

  Title: Life events and depression
  Description: |-
    Baumeister explored people’s reactions to experiences of setbacks and personal failures. He found that most suicide attempts are preceded by some failure or setback that reflects badly on the self.

    He explored how people respond to distressing experiences by focusing narrowly on the present moment in an attempt to avoid the painful emotions caused by recent failure, which shuts off the mind to states of self awareness and problem solving capacities.

    “Time seems to drag, and the person remains stuck in a relatively empty present moment, cut off from past and future. Deprived of reasons for action, the person may become passive, lethargic, and idle.”

    Researchers have found that some types of abuse had a particularly strong association with the development of depression in comparison to others.

    Psychological abuse was more strongly associated with depression than any other forms of maltreatment

    “Verbal and nonverbal acts by a close other in a position of power,” was more strongly associated with depression than any of the other forms of maltreatment.

    Childhood neglect, where a caretaker fails to provide for the child’s basic emotional and material needs, was also strongly related to depression.

    lead to rumination, which is the habit of becoming caught in repetitive and ongoing
    cycles of negative evaluations about ourselves. \n\nThis is why many therapies
    and approaches to depression focus on observing our thoughts, introducing more
    positive activities into our lives or speaking with others about our problems.

  Title: 'Mindfulness for depression '
  Description: "Mindfulness has been described by Jon Kabat Zinn as’ paying attention
    in a particular way; on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgementally.’\n\nMindfulness
    allows us to take a new perspective on our experience, one that is characterised
    by openness, curiosity and acceptance. This allows us to strengthen brain networks
    that enable us to view our thoughts as mental events rather than permanent and
    factual aspects of our experience.\n\nRecent research has found that young people
    who took part in mindfulness programmes experience a range of beneficial outcomes
    including reduced depression, improved coping skills, improved mood, and improved
    post-traumatic stress symptoms.  \n\nA review of nine clinical trials analyzing
    people with severe depression found MBCT reduced a patient’s chances of relapsing
    for up to 60 weeks, regardless of their sex, age, education or relationship status. "

    overcoming an episode of depression in our lives.\n\n* Relationships can feel
    difficult to maintain while experiencing depression as it can cause feelings of
    worthlessness, low mood and a desire to withdraw from our social world.  \n\nBy
    connecting and communicating with a small amount of close and trusted people in
    our lives, it can help to support us through our experience by providing us with:
    \n\n**Acceptance and understanding **\n**Empathy and compassion** \n**Practical
    support and help with everyday tasks**"

    * People who experience depression often feel confused, guilty and shameful around the experience of not meeting the expectations of themselves and others.

    * The resistance to feeling the painful emotional states is one of the factors that causes depression to perpetuate.

    * Our close relationships can provide us with a safe space to express painful emotions and bring awareness and acceptance to our experience of depression.

  Title: What is Unconditional Positive Regard?
  Description: |-
    Unconditional Positive Regard is a term coined by Carl Rogers, who developed person centred-therapy a method where the person seeking therapy was seen as central to the direction of the therapeutic work and held as the expert of their own experience. Rogers used the term to describe the complete and loving acceptance of another person.

    ‘ True empathy is always free of any evaluative or diagnostic quality’

  Title: 'Why is unconditional  positive regard beneficial for depression? '
  Description: |-
    People who are experiencing depression often hold an underlying belief that they are not loveable, are flawed and not worthy of love & acceptance.  

    Why is unconditional positive regard important when people are experiencing depression? 


    By showing unconditional positive regard it allows others to open up about negative beliefs and parts of themselves they feel ashamed of. 

    Unconditional positive regard removes any judgement or evaluation of others and allows others to feel that they are able to be accepted for who they are, without needing to change.

  Title: 'Behavioural activation '
  Description: "The idea behind behavioural activation is to gradually change small
    aspects of how we live, so that we can slowly change our experience of ourselves
    in our everyday lives and explore what changes positively affect your mood and
    wellbeing. \n\nBehaviour Activation works by increasing the amount of rewarding
    activities in your life. By changing habits and behaviours it creates new pathways
    in the brain that reinforce behaviour change. \n\nPast research has proven  that
    BA is effective for treating depression. "

  Title: 'Tips for behavioural activation '
  Description: |-
    Don’t chose what you think you should do, chose something that you personally enjoy and want to do. Imagine a positive life that you want to have, what sorts of activities and things are you doing?

    The aim is to allow yourself to feel joy, contentment and other positive and reassuring feelings through the activities in your everyday life.

  Title: Start small and make it measurable
  Description: |2-
     Chose something small. This could be anything from

    **‘ I want to make my bed every morning’ to\
    ‘ I want to go to a life drawing class this week.’**

    Ask others to help you. By asking for the support of your friends it will help reinforce your goals and will also mean that you can share the experience with somebody else. Ask if they can help you build it into your routine.

    Recording your progress will provide more of a sense of control. Once every few weeks reflect on how things have changes and what difference these changes, no matter how small, have made on your mood.

  Title: 'Finding a balance '
  Description: "Ultimately, our mood is influenced by many aspects of our lives. It
    is natural and normal to feel uncomfortable emotions and to be triggered by difficult
    events in our lives. \n\nSometimes we may spend longer periods of time feeling
    low and powerless over how we experience life. \n\nOvercoming depression involves
    developing an understanding of the areas of our lives that are not serving us,
    or that are out of balance, so that we can support ourselves to find new ways
    of experiencing self care, meaning and purpose in our lives.  "
