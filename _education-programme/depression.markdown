  Title: What is depression?
  Description: "Depression is an experience that is manifests in our mental, emotional
    and physical experience. \n\nIt is characterised by an intense preoccupation with
    negative thinking about our past, current and future self. \n\nThese ways of thinking
    are accompanied by an emotional experience of meaninglessness and ‘apathy’, which
    is the loss of interest or pleasure in life.\n\nPeople experiencing depression
    also experience changes to their physical state, such as increased tiredness and
    fatigue and difficulty concentrating. "
