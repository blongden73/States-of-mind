  Title: Depression
  Description: Depression is an experience that is manifests in our mental, emotional
    and physical experience. It is characterised by an intense preoccupation with
    negative thinking about our past, current and future self. These ways of thinking
    are accompanied by an emotional experience of meaninglessness and ‘apathy’, which
    is the loss of interest or pleasure in life. People experiencing depression also
    experience changes to their physical state, such as increased tiredness and fatigue
    and difficulty concentrating.
