  Image: 
  Description: "Self awareness is the ability to notice our thoughts, feelings and
    behaviour, as if we are an observer.\nSelf awareness allows us to understand ourselves
    and the impact we have on others. \nSelf awareness is a tool that provides us
    with the power of choice, to redefine our narrative of how we experience ourselves.
    \nThrough practicing self awareness, we can make new choices about how we live
    our lives and enhance our sense of wellbeing. "

  Description: "The Johari Window is a visual representation of aspects of the self
    that are known or unknown to ourselves and others. \n\n**Joseph Luft and Harrington
    Ingham \n**\nThe open area represents everything we know about ourselves. This
    is what people who know us know about us and what we are consciously aware of
    too. \n\nThe hidden area relates to all of the parts of ourselves that we do not
    share with others. This information that we keep private may relate to our fears
    and insecurities swell as your hopes and dreams.  \n\nThe blind spot relates to
    our potential for personal growth through our close and trusted relationships.
    Our friends and family can provide us with feedback and honesty that can help
    us to see ourselves more clearly. This can relate to both our positive attributes
    and areas for growth. \n\nThe unknown relates to information about ourselves that
    is unconscious to both ourselves and others. This relates to parts of ourselves
    we still have yet to discover through new experiences. \n\n"

  Description: "Self Awareness has been proven as a tool that can help us to flourish.\n\nThe
    insight that self awareness provides allows us to feel more satisfied with our
    lives. \n\nWhen cultivated fully, we no longer repress or hide our emotions or
    experiences and instead see them as ways to learn and grow.  \n\nSelf awareness
    allows us to develop insight into our problems, behaviours and personal experiences.
    \n\nThis process of bringing conscious awareness to how we are living is the first
    step to having confidence that we can change our lives to be more positive and
    fulfilling. Without this insight and this belief in change, it is very difficult
    to know we can develop ourselves and we can become stuck feeling as if we have
    no control over how things are. \n\nHarrington, Rick,Loffredo, Donald 2010/11/30,

    \n\nBy developing this self-knowledge we can understand ourselves and personal

    from so that we can begin to resolve them. \n\n# Self awareness improves our relationship
    with ourselves and others. \n\nBy being more aware of how we are acting towards
    ourselves and in our relationships, we can improve the quality of these relationships,
    which are key to experiencing a fulfilling life.  \n\n# Self awareness improves
    our confidence and self esteem. \n\nPeople with self awareness have more clarity
    about who they are, what they believe in and what their personal goals are. Without
    this clarity, it can be easy to lack self assurance and struggle with low self
    esteem."

  Title: 'How can self awareness impact how we experience our identity? '
  Image: 
  Description: "\nWe like to think of ourselves as one consistent personality or person
    but in reality, we are composed of many different aspects and parts, that all
    serve an important role in our lives. \nSelf awareness allows us to recognise
    that our identity is not fixed but is an ever-changing reflection of our experiences,
    values and relationships. Self awareness allows us to explore the emotional connection
    or resistance we have to them.  \n\nBy exploring the different aspects of our
    personal identity we can gain a deeper understanding of what makes us unique and
    what connects us most fundamentally with others.  \n\nWe can then develop insights
    into the causes of our problems and our potential for growth, and recover our
    gifts and qualities that we are blind to.  "

  Title: Identity
  Image: 
  Description: "Our definition of identity isn’t fixed as we view it as a subjective
    and personal experience of how we chose to view ourselves. \n\nOur identity relates
    to our self - image:  our perception of our value and our role in the world. Our
    identity changes and evolves as we develop, reflecting the dynamic inter-relationship
    between our life experience and our sense of self. \n\n\nAs our life history and
    identity are so closely related, exploring and bringing awareness to different
    aspects of our identity can provide an important foundation for self-discovery,
    self awareness and personal growth. \n\nExploring our identity can make us aware
    of past experiences that can bring up uncomfortable feelings and memories. While
    practicing these exercises, it’s important to remember that your identity is never
    fixed and that giving ourselves space and time to process and feel our reactions
    to parts of our identity is part of the healing process. "

  Title: How does identity relate to how we live?
  Image: 
  Description: "Everyday we have an experience of who we are. Sometimes this is a
    positive experience that affirms a clear and motivated sense of ourselves in the
    world, while at other times we can experience ourselves as struggling, unable
    to cope and helpless to our challenges. \n\nOur mental health is reflected in
    our self image and so by developing the ability to reflect on ourselves we can
    develop more emotional and mental flexibility over how we experience our self
    image. This skill can be developed throughout life and is crucial for our mental
    health, relationships and general enjoyment of life. "

  Title: Your name
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Our name is a personal and special aspect of our identity. It is a part of our identity that we are very familiar with, yet we do not always pause to consider the meaning our name has for us. The act of bringing conscious awareness to an aspect of ourselves allows us to connect more deeply with our sense of who we are and the meaning this part of us has in our lives.  We will begin this module by using a reflection on your name to help you understand how self-awareness can be developed and bring us a more conscious understanding of ourselves. 

    By bringing awareness to our name, we can begin to access the unconscious feelings, associations and memories that are connected with this part of our identity.

  Title: Identity, authenticity and mental health
  Image: 
  Description: "Carl Jung was a Swiss Psychologist who explored the personality and
    human nature. He was responsible for introducing concepts such as introversion
    and extroversion and the collective unconcious. \nJung believed that ‘individuation’
    was a process that was the main purpose of human development. This idea was that
    psychological health is achieved by seeking to live authentically ( to feel and
    act in accordance with who we most essentially are).  He believed that everybody
    had the ability and the impulse to move towards our fullest potential  and that
    we achieved this by becoming aware of aspects of ourselves we ignore or are unconscious
    to, aswell as the unmanifested potential that exists within us. \nFor Jung, healing
    was a process of reconnecting with our true nature and rediscovering our unique
    and personal interests, desires and ways of being in the world. "

  Title: 'The younger you and the authentic self '
  Image: 
  Description: "Under the many layers of our identity and our personality is our true
    self, this part of us never changes and exists throughout our life as our innermost
    being. It exists independently of our thoughts, feelings and roles that we play
    in the world. When we are connected with our authentic self, we are able to live
    freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, we accept
    our qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who we most
    essentially are. \n\nThroughout our lives, we change and adapt parts of ourself
    to maintain our relationships with others and to fit in to what we think other
    people want us to be. This part of the module explores the conflict we can all
    experience between wanting to be true to ourselves and wanting to fit in with
    the world around us. \n\nThis next part of the module will explore the authentic
    self and the different ‘masks’ or sub-personalities that we show to the world. "

  Title: 'Inner child '
  Image: 
  Description: "The inner child is a psychological practice that allows us to reconnect
    with our essential nature. \nAs young children, we do not change or adapt our
    behaviour for others but express our needs, interests and sense of self authentically.
    \nBy reconnecting with our younger self, we can discover and reintegrate lost
    qualities of ourselves and bring them into our present lives more fully. This
    is a therapeutic process that can help us to develop our self awareness and self
    esteem."

  Title: 'PART 3: SOCIETY AND IDENTITY '
  Image: 
  Description: "We live in a social world and many aspects of our personalities are
    shaped by the social relationships and situations we encounter throughout our
    lives. \nAs it is impossible for our close relationships to be fully present all
    the time and for us to be completely present to others, we have adapted a way
    to fit our environments by adapting our personality to defend ourselves or meet
    your need for connection.  \nAn example of this is noticing when somebody seems
    to have a different personality depending on what group they are in, or when we
    notice we behave differently depending on who we are. This is a completely normal
    process but understanding the process behind it can help us develop an awareness
    of how parts of our identity are shaped by our desire to fit in and be accepted. "

  Description: |-
    Personality comes from the greek word, ‘persona’ which means mask. Our personality refers to the different faces that we show to the world and the many different ways we behave, speak, think and relate with other people. Behind our personality is our true Self, which does not change over time or adapt to different circumstances, but contains our essential nature. 
     
    Sub personalities are distinct personality structures that we identify with and act out. Sub personalities develop when we feel we cannot express our true nature and need to adapt or change some aspect of ourselves to be loved, accepted and acknowledged. Sub personalities are not bad or something to be removed, they are a very normal part of psychological development as they allow us to survive and adapt to an unpredictable social world.

  Title: 'The psychology of Sub-personalities '
  Image: 
  Description: "Subpersonalities are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have
    followed since childhood\n\nWhen people fail to respond empathetically to our
    true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents
    or our environment need us to be. A psychotherapist called Winnicott, called this
    process of adapting, the development of the ‘False Self’. It is also referred
    to as the Survival Personality. \n\nThese are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings
    and behaviours that we develop to adapt to various environments where we feel
    unable to be our authentic self. In neuroscience these are viewed as distinct
    neural networks that function as ‘specialised selves’ or ‘self states’. ( Siegel
    1993) \n\nDaniel Stern summarises the psychological view on these multiple selves:
    ‘ It is now largely accepted that there are multiple ( context -specific) selves
    that can interact with each other, observe each other, and converse together out
    of consciousness. This is normal, not limited to pathological dissociative states.’
    (Stern 2004) \n\nSub-personality theory explains personality development and helps
    to explain why parts of our personality can feel conflicted and as if there are
    ‘multiple selves’ within us who have different ways of being. \n\nFor example
    the feeling of ‘ I want to do this but another part of me wants to do that’, or
    ‘ I shouldn’t be getting angry right now but I think its important I tell the
    truth’ "

  Title: How are sub-personalities related to mental health? 
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Subpersonalities cause us difficulties when we identify with this one part of ourselves and believe it to be all of us. For example, if we are identified with the ‘ High achiever’ part of ourselves, it may help us to get good grades and maintain a motivation for developing our knowledge and experience. However, if we become over identified with this part of ourselves we may become very distressed by setbacks, we may spend less time with our friends or we may never be satisfied with what we have achieved. 
     
    Our sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need. By exploring these parts of ourselves, we can develop our self awareness and integrate the many different parts of ourselves. You can imagine your sub-personalities as an orchestra and your awareness as the conductor. By bringing awareness to your different sub personalities you can integrate them and enable them to work together as a harmonious whole.

  Image: 
  Description: " \t1.\tWe learn to connect with our different and contradictory ways
    of acting in the world. This raises our awareness of our behaviour and helps us
    to make sense of how we can seem to be different versions of ourselves in different
    circumstances. \L\n\t2.\tWe learn to free ourselves of the unconscious forces
    that cause us to get trapped in certain aspects of our personality. For example,
    a very critical part of ourselves. \L\n\t3.\tWe integrate the different aspects
    of our personality which causes us to feel less conflict within ourselves. \L\n\t4.\tWe
    emphasise all of the beneficial qualities of our sub-personalities and recognise
    how they serve us. \L\n\t5.\tBy identifying with our different sub-peronalities,
    it allows us to develop a greater awareness of what is our true self and what
    is a mask or persona. \L"

    our times in groups that have an influence on us and which reflect our values,
    beliefs and mindsets about who we are. Groups provide us with a sense of belonging,
    which is one of our most important needs in terms of our mental health and wellbeing. \n\nResearch
    has shown consistently that the quality of our social world is one of the most
    significant indicators of our wellbeing and ability to recover from difficult
    times in our lives.  "

  Description: "‘ Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger
    than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting
    in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging,
    but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present
    our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never
    be greater than our level of self-acceptance.’ \nDaring Greatly by Brene Browne "
