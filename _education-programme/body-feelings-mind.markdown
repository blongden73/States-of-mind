  Description: "Mind-body approaches to wellbeing focus on developing a balance between
    our emotional, psychological and physical wellbeing in a sustained and gradual
    way over time. \n\nThis model views healing and wellbeing as a consequence of
    our ability to take notice and develop awareness of the state of our  body, feelings
    and mind in our daily life. "

  Title: 'How effective are mind-body techniques? '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Mind body techniques have been shown to improve depression in both children and adults.

    In one study, 129 Palestinian children and teenagers took part in a 10-week mind-body skills programme that included meditation, breathing techniques and self expression through drawings and movement. After the programme the participants reported feeling significantly less feelings of hopelessness (a common experience in depression).

    The young people experienced improvements in their depression after 7 months, despite continuing to live through conflict and adversity.

    Further research has shown that mind-body techniques enable higher levels of self awareness, motivation and improvements in mood and behaviour.

    Everybody has 3 distinct states that we can become conscious to that are both separate from each other and inter-related:

    * Mental states

    * Emotional states

    * Physical states

    Some people may naturally be more connected with either their body, feelings or mind and we each have our own unique relationship to all three, like a fingerprint or personal map.

  Title: Why is interoception important for mental health?
  Image: 
  Description: "Interoception is the ability to become aware of our emotions and the
    physical sensations in our body. It is a skill that provides us with a starting
    point for regulating our moods and physical wellbeing. \n\nBy bringing awareness
    to our internal sensations and emotions, through the process of interoception,
    we can reduce the intensity of the distress and discomfort that we experience.
    \n\nWhen we turn towards our discomfort, with an attitude of curiosity and acceptance,
    we begin to develop the ability to regulate and reduce it.\n\n"

  Title: Vagus Nerve
  Image: "/uploads/vagus%20nerve-49f2ca.jpg"
  Description: "The vagus nerve connects your brain to many important organs throughout
    the body, including the stomach, heart and lungs.\n\nThe vagus nerve is also a
    key part of your parasympathetic “rest and digest” nervous system. It influences
    your breathing, digestive function and heart rate, all of which can have a huge
    impact on your mental health.\n\nHaving higher vagal tone means that your body
    can relax faster after stress as increasing the 'tone' of your vagus nerve activates
    the parasympathetic nervous system. \n\nIn 2010, research showed there was a positive
    feedback loop between high vagal tone, positive emotions, and good physical health.

  Title: When the vagus nerve is out of balance
  Image: 
  Description: "Our brain can become overstimulated, causing mental tension, anxiety
    and rumination. \n\n# Feelings Stressed and Overwhelmed \n\nWhen we are stressed
    and overwhelmed, we are more likely to become ill and are vulnerable to catching
    a cold or suffering from other illnesses related to the immune system. When the
    parasympathetic nervous system is active, it suppresses the immune response in
    the body. \n\n# Health problems and inflammation \n\nWhen the calming effects
    of the vagus nerve are inhibited through stress, our body can experience inflammation
    and this can lead to a range of health conditions. There is an extensive body
    of research that links inflammation to chronic health conditions. "

  Description: "Breathing is a tool that we can use to connect us with our bodies
    and restore balance to the underlying biological cause of stress, tension and
    emotional distress. \n\nWhen we breathe deeply, our diaphragm presses against
    the vagus nerve. This nerve is responsible for sending impulses to the brain and
    signals to our mind it can relax. \n"

  Title: Movement and emotions
  Image: "/uploads/melody-jacob-IJcdUTz7AyM-unsplash.jpg"
  Description: "When we experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected
    in our body as tension and discomfort. We can release this tension and discomfort
    by bringing awareness to our body and physical experience.\n\nOne of the ways
    we manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into our minds. Often we
    don’t realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to
    bring awareness to ourselves in the present moment and reconnect with our bodies
    as a way to calm ourselves and rebalance our mood. \n\nDance movement psychotherapy
    is effective because it allows us to use our bodies to influence our mood and
    release trapped and difficult emotions. \n"

  Title: 'Yoga: Calming the body '
  Image: "/uploads/DeathtoStock_Fitness1.jpg"
  Description: "Yoga has been proven to have a range of benefits for mental health.
    Yoga works by reducing stress, relieving muscle tension and inflammation and calming
    the nervous system. \n\nThese physical benefits are correlated with improved attention
    and concentration and significant improvements in mood and relaxation. Yoga is
    beneficial for a range of distressing states, such as anxiety, depression and
    PTSD. \n\nA study followed 64 women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
    which is characterized by severe anxiety and fear following exposure to a traumatic
    event. After 10 weeks, 52% of participants no longer met the criteria for PTSD
    at all.  \n"

    impact on our wellbeing in our everyday life. \n\nLike our relationship to our
    body and mind, everybody has a unique relationship with their feelings and this
    relationship can change and evolve over time.\n\nBy bringing awareness to our
    relationship to our feelings, it can help us to manage our difficult feelings
    more easily, develop stronger relationships with others and overcome challenging
    times with more clarity and confidence. \n"

  Image: "/uploads/emotions%202.jpg"
  Description: "Emotional awareness is the ability to observe, name and express what
    we are feeling. \n\nEmotional communication depends on this awareness and enables
    us to share our experiences more richly and accurately with others. \n\nBy developing
    this ability we can help ourselves to resolve misunderstandings with others, understand
    our reactions and find meaning in our experiences. "

  Title: 'Observing the Tendency of the Mind to Distraction '
  Image: 
  Description: "\n\nThe first lesson in using the mind is to observe its tendency
    to become distracted by intruding thoughts. \n\nOur mind likes to comment on our
    experiences. It comments on everything, from how we are feeling, to what we think
    about other people and the experiences we have. \n\nThe mind is always changing
    because our moods are always changing. We run into problems with the mind when
    we begin to believe that everything we are thinking is the only experience that
    is possible. "

  Title: Understanding the nature of the mind 
  Image: 
  Description: "\nOften, we do not realise how much our mind and thoughts have an
    impact on how we are feeling. By bringing awareness to the nature of our mind
    and by understanding how to control its different aspects, we can dramatically
    improve the quality of our lives. \n\nThis part of the course is designed to teach
    you how to examine and gain more awareness of your mind and thought processes.\n\nThere
    is a tendency for the mind to become distracted, which makes us feel lost and
    unclear about what we want to focus on. \n\nTo train the mind, we must learn how
    to control our attention and bring balance to it’s different tendencies so that
    we can use the mind, instead of allowing ourselves to become stuck in autopilot. "

  Title: 'Rumination '
  Image: "/uploads/rumination%204-7271b0.jpg"
  Description: "\nIn Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything
    that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms.
    One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress,
    Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.\n\nRumination happens when we become caught
    in a particular story about our lives which limits our focus to repetitive thought
    patterns. \n\nHigh levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety
    and low mood. \n\nWhen we ruminate, we often feel trapped in our thinking and
    can’t see a way out. This makes us feel low and makes us believe that our life
    is our thoughts. But this is not the case. \n\nOur mind is just one part of our
    experience and we can use it in many different ways. "

  Image: 
  Description: "Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing our awareness to
    the present moment consciously and non-judgementally. \n\nOften, our thoughts
    become preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on our past or overanalysing
    our personal experiences. \n\nThrough mindfulness, we can ‘step back’ and become
    attuned to our present moment experience and step back from our attachment to
    thinking. "

  Title: The rational mind
  Image: "/uploads/ratioonal%20mind-00dcc7.jpg"
  Description: "\n\nWhen you create from the rational mind, things seem very factual
    and concrete. This is really helpful for answering questions and providing information
    for other people to understand. You can use your rational mind to convey your
    thoughts in a way that is simple and clear.\n\nThe rational mind is also really
    helpful for communicating things you have already learned and want to tell to
    others. \n\nThis is why people often get into arguments when they use their rational
    mind because they are communicating different things that they understand but
    not considering other possibilities with their imagination. "

  Title: Getting stuck in the rational
  Image: 
  Description: "\nSometimes the rational mind can get so caught up in facts and information
    that we already know or want to understand that we forget to use our imagination
    to consider how it can be used in other ways and also how other people have made
    sense of the information from their own perspective.\n\nEverybody has a different
    perspective and so information can seem very different to different people. The
    way that you interpret the information depends on who is teaching you, your experiences
    of the information before and what you want to use the information to do. \n\nIf
    you want to use the information to add to your beliefs about something then this
    means that you will often learn the information in a way that serves your beliefs,
    rather than in a way that can be discussed and changes over time. "

    use as much, so it can take a bit of practice to remind ourselves of what it feels
    like to use this part of the mind.\n\nThis part of the mind is much softer and
    it enjoys working in ways that are more imaginative, like storytelling. \n "

  Title: 'Imagination '
  Image: "/uploads/imagine.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Whenever somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps us to imagine future possibilities and helps us to access parts of our experience we have not yet seen. When we close our eyes and allow ourselves to imagine something, it helps us to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening. 

    When we get stuck with a decision, it’s because we feel like we don’t know what the outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people we are having the problem with, we can visualise other aspects that we can’t access when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one belief or potential situation.

    Mindsets are the belief patterns that influence how we think and behave in our everyday lives. Some Mindsets/ beliefs are very unconscious to us, while others are more apparent in our lives. 

    Many of our Mindsets are formed in childhood and adolescence and we hold onto these throughout our lives. By exploring our mindsets we can become aware of how they serve or limit us. By becoming aware of how they limit us, we can chose to let go of the resistance they create in our lives.

    world. \n\nOften if our lives are busy and we are very caught in our thoughts,
    it can be difficult to step back and observe how our feelings and emotions are.
    \n\nIf our feelings get trapped or ignored it can contribute to a lot of tension
    and discomfort. \n\nThis activity allows you to gently connect with your feelings
    in a therapeutic way, using a simple drawing exercise. \n\n"

  Title: Letter writing and emotional expression
  Image: 
  Description: "We often rely on relationships with other people to help us regulate
    our emotions but in the absence of these supportive environments it is important
    that we find healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions on our own.\n\nLetter
    writing, or journaling has been found to be a really effective way to identify
    and process our emotional world. \n\nThis letter writing exercise is focused on
    expressing our emotions towards other people but we can also journal about our
    own thoughts and feelings to help us make sense of them. \n\nThe process works
    in a similar way to communicating with words, as we are externalising our distress
    which allows us to view it in a new way."
