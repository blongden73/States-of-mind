  Description: "Mind-body approaches to wellbeing focus on developing a balance between
    our emotional, psychological and physical wellbeing in a sustained and gradual
    way over time. \n\nThis model views healing and wellbeing as a consequence of
    our ability to take notice and develop awareness of the state of our  body, feelings
    and mind in our daily life. "

  Title: 'How effective are mind-body techniques? '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Mind body techniques have been shown to improve depression in both children and adults.

    In one study, 129 Palestinian children and teenagers took part in a 10-week mind-body skills programme that included meditation, breathing techniques and self expression through drawings and movement. After the programme the participants reported feeling significantly less feelings of hopelessness (a common experience in depression).

    The young people experienced improvements in their depression after 7 months, despite continuing to live through conflict and adversity.

    Further research has shown that mind-body techniques enable higher levels of self awareness, motivation and improvements in mood and behaviour.

  Title: Why is interoception important for mental health?
  Image: 
  Description: "Interoception is a skill that allows us to perceive our internal states
    and sensations of our body, feelings and mind. It is a skill that provides us
    with a starting point for regulating our moods, thoughts and physical health.
    \n\nBy bringing awareness to the state of our body, feelings and mind, through
    the process of interoception, we can reduce the intensity of the distress and
    discomfort that we experience. \n\nWhen we turn towards our discomfort, with an
    attitude of curiosity and acceptance, we begin to develop the ability to regulate
    and reduce it.\n\n"

  Title: Vagus Nerve
  Image: "/uploads/vagus%20nerve-49f2ca.jpg"
  Description: "The vagus nerve is the part of our body that is responsible for a
    large part of the mind-body connection. \n\nThe vagus nerve sends messages between
    our internal body parts and our brain, sending messages back and forth that affect
    the functioning of our physical body and mental states.\n\nWhen the vagus nerve
    is not activated enough, our brain can become overstimulated, causing mental tension,
    anxiety and rumination. \n\nWe notice the effect of the vagus nerve when we do
    things that relieve physical tension and our minds become more relaxed and focused. "

  Title: 'How else is the vagus nerve related to our mental health? '
  Image: 
  Description: "# Experiencing a Threat \n\nWhen we experience a threat, the vagus
    nerve sends a message to our digestive system to stop producing digestive enzymes
    and to stop ourselves feeling hungry so that we can focus our energy and resources
    on responding to the threat around us. This is why when we feel stressed and anxious,
    we feel butterflies in our stomach and other uncomfortable feelings in our belly. 
    \n\n# Feelings Stressed and Overwhelmed \n\nWhen we are stressed and overwhelmed,
    we are more likely to become ill and are vulnerable to catching a cold or suffering
    from other illnesses related to the immune system. When the parasympathetic nervous
    system is active, it suppresses the immune response in the body. \n\n# Health
    problems and inflammation \n\nWhen the calming effects of the vagus nerve are
    inhibited through stress, our body can experience inflammation and this can lead
    to a range of health conditions. There is an extensive body of research that links
    inflammation to chronic health conditions. Stress impairs functioning of the nervous
    system which produces this inflammation and therefore it is important to use the
    body's natural mechanism - breathing, to maintain balance and bring the balance
    of the body back to its healthy state. "

  Description: "Breathing is a tool that we can use to connect us with our bodies
    and restore balance to the underlying biological cause of stress, tension and
    emotional distress. \n\nWhen we breathe deeply, our diaphragm presses against
    the vagus nerve. This nerve is responsible for sending impulses to the brain and
    signals to our mind it can relax. \n"

  Title: Movement and emotions
  Image: "/uploads/dance%203.jpg"
  Description: "When we experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected
    in our body as tension and discomfort. We can release this tension and discomfort
    by bringing awareness to our body and physical experience.\n\nOne of the ways
    we manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into our minds. Often we
    don’t realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to
    bring awareness to ourselves in the present moment and reconnect with our bodies
    as a way to calm ourselves and rebalance our mood. \n\nDance movement psychotherapy
    is effective because it allows us to learn how this process works as it allows
    us to experience the power of how we can use our bodies to influence our mood
    and release trapped and difficult emotions. \n\n\n"

  Title: 'Yoga : Calming the body '
  Image: "/uploads/yooooga.jpg"
  Description: "Yoga has been proven to have a range of benefits for mental health.
    \n\nYoga works by reducing stress, relieving muscle tension and inflammation and
    calming the nervous system. \n\nThese physical benefits are correlated with improved
    attention and concentration and significant improvements in mood and relaxation.
    \ \n\nYoga is beneficial for a range of distressing states, such as anxiety, depression
    and PTSD. \n\nA study followed 64 women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
    which is characterized by severe anxiety and fear following exposure to a traumatic
    event.\n\nAfter 10 weeks, 52% of participants no longer met the criteria for PTSD
    at all.  \n"

    impact on our wellbeing in our everyday life. \n\nLike our relationship to our
    body and mind, everybody has a unique relationship with their feelings and this
    relationship can change and evolve over time.\n\nBy bringing awareness to our
    relationship to our feelings, it can help us to manage our difficult feelings
    more easily, develop stronger relationships with others and overcome challenging
    times with more clarity and confidence. \n"

  Description: "Emotional awareness is the ability to observe, name and express what
    we are feeling. \n\nEmotional communication depends on this awareness and enables
    us to share our experiences more richly and accurately with others. \n\nBy developing
    this ability we can help ourselves to resolve misunderstandings with others, understand
    our reactions and find meaning in our experiences. "

  Title: 'Observing the Tendency of the Mind to Distraction '
  Image: 
  Description: "\n\nThe first lesson in using the mind is to observe its tendency
    to become distracted by intruding thoughts. \n\nBy eliminating distractions, you
    will be able to observe the mind with greater clarity. We will start with simple
    exercises to help you understand this. \n\nOur mind likes to comment on our experiences.
    It comments on everything, from how we are feeling, to what we think about other
    people and the experiences we have. When we say we feel like ‘changing our mind’
    it is because the feelings that we are having are causing us to have different
    thoughts about the same situation. \n\nThe mind is always changing because our
    moods are always changing. We run into problems with the mind when we begin to
    believe that everything we are thinking is the only experience that is possible. "

  Title: Understanding the nature of the mind 
  Image: 
  Description: "\nOften, we do not realise how much our mind and thoughts have an
    impact on how we are feeling. By bringing awareness to the nature of our mind
    and by understanding how to control its different aspects, we can dramatically
    improve the quality of our lives. \n\nThis part of the course is designed to teach
    you how to examine and gain more awareness of your mind and thought processes.\n\nThere
    is a tendency for the mind to become distracted, which makes us feel lost and
    unclear about what we want to focus on. \n\nTo train the mind, we must learn how
    to control our attention and bring balance to it’s different tendencies so that
    we can use the mind, instead of allowing ourselves to become stuck in autopilot. "

  Title: 'Rumination '
  Image: "/uploads/rumination%204-7271b0.jpg"
  Description: "\nIn Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything
    that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms.
    One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress,
    Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.\n\nRumination happens when we become caught
    in a particular story about our lives which limits our focus to repetitive thought
    patterns. \n\nHigh levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety
    and low mood. \n\nWhen we ruminate, we often feel trapped in our thinking and
    can’t see a way out. This makes us feel low and makes us believe that our life
    is our thoughts. But this is not the case. \n\nOur mind is just one part of our
    experience and we can use it in many different ways. "

  Image: 
  Description: "Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing our awareness to
    the present moment consciously and non-judgementally. \n\nOften, our thoughts
    become preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on our past or overanalysing
    our personal experiences. \n\nThrough mindfulness, we can ‘step back’ and become
    attuned to our present moment experience and step back from our attachment to
    thinking. "

  Title: The rational mind
  Image: "/uploads/ratioonal%20mind-00dcc7.jpg"
  Description: "\n\nWhen you create from the rational mind, things seem very factual
    and concrete. This is really helpful for answering questions and providing information
    for other people to understand. You can use your rational mind to convey your
    thoughts in a way that is simple and clear.\n\nThe rational mind is also really
    helpful for communicating things you have already learned and want to tell to
    others. \n\nThis is why people often get into arguments when they use their rational
    mind because they are communicating different things that they understand but
    not considering other possibilities with their imagination. "

  Title: Getting stuck in the rational
  Image: 
  Description: "\nSometimes the rational mind can get so caught up in facts and information
    that we already know or want to understand that we forget to use our imagination
    to consider how it can be used in other ways and also how other people have made
    sense of the information from their own perspective.\n\nEverybody has a different
    perspective and so information can seem very different to different people. The
    way that you interpret the information depends on who is teaching you, your experiences
    of the information before and what you want to use the information to do. \n\nIf
    you want to use the information to add to your beliefs about something then this
    means that you will often learn the information in a way that serves your beliefs,
    rather than in a way that can be discussed and changes over time. "

    use as much, so it can take a bit of practice to remind ourselves of what it feels
    like to use this part of the mind.\n\nThis part of the mind is much softer and
    it enjoys working in ways that are more imaginative, like storytelling. \n "

  Title: 'Imagination '
  Image: "/uploads/imagine.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Whenever somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps us to imagine future possibilities and helps us to access parts of our experience we have not yet seen. When we close our eyes and allow ourselves to imagine something, it helps us to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening. 

    When we get stuck with a decision, it’s because we feel like we don’t know what the outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people we are having the problem with, we can visualise other aspects that we can’t access when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one belief or potential situation.

    it can be difficult to step back and observe how our feelings and emotions are.
    \n\nIf our feelings get trapped or ignored it can contribute to a lot of tension
    and discomfort. \n\nThis activity allows you to gently connect with your feelings
    in a therapeutic way, using a simple drawing exercise. \n\n"

  Title: Letter writing and emotional expression
  Image: 
  Description: "We often rely on relationships with other people to help us regulate
    our emotions but in the absence of these supportive environments it is important
    that we find healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions on our own.\n\nLetter
    writing, or journaling has been found to be a really effective way to identify
    and process our emotional world. \n\nThis letter writing exercise is focused on
    expressing our emotions towards other people but we can also journal about our
    own thoughts and feelings to help us make sense of them. \n\nThe process works
    in a similar way to communicating with words, as we are externalising our distress
    which allows us to view it in a new way."
