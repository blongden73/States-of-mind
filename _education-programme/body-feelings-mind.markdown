  Description: "Mind-body approaches to wellbeing focus on developing a balance between
    our emotional, psychological and physical wellbeing in a sustained and gradual
    way over time. \n\nThis model views healing and wellbeing as a consequence of
    your ability to take notice and develop awareness of the state of your body, feelings
    and mind in your daily life. "

  Title: 'How effective are mind-body techniques? '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Mind body techniques have been shown to improve depression in both children and adults.

    In one study, 129 Palestinian children and teenagers took part in a 10-week mind-body skills programme that included meditation, breathing techniques and self expression through drawings and movement. After the programme the participants reported feeling significantly less feelings of hopelessness (a common experience in depression).

    The young people experienced improvements in their depression after 7 months, despite continuing to live through conflict and adversity.

    Further research has shown that mind-body techniques enable higher levels of self awareness, motivation and improvements in mood and behaviour.

    There are 3 distinct states that you can become conscious to that are both separate from each other and inter-related:

    * Mental states

    * Emotional states

    * Physical states

    You may naturally be more connected with either your body, feelings or mind and each person has their own unique relationship to all three, like a fingerprint or personal map.

  Title: Why is interoception important for mental health?
  Image: 
  Description: "Interoception is the ability to become aware of your emotions and
    the physical sensations in your body. It is a skill that provides you with a starting
    point for regulating your moods and physical wellbeing. \n\nBy bringing awareness
    to your internal sensations and emotions, through the process of interoception,
    you can reduce the intensity of the distress and discomfort that you experience.
    \n\nWhen you turn towards our discomfort, with an attitude of curiosity and acceptance,
    you can begin to develop the ability to regulate and reduce it.\n\n"

  Title: Vagus Nerve
  Image: "/uploads/vagus%20nerve-49f2ca.jpg"
  Description: "The vagus nerve connects your brain to many important organs throughout
    your body, including your stomach, heart and lungs.\n\nThe vagus nerve is also
    a key part of your parasympathetic “rest and digest” nervous system. It influences
    your breathing, digestive function and heart rate, all of which can have a huge
    impact on your mental health.\n\nHaving higher vagal tone means that your body
    can relax faster after stress as increasing the 'tone' of your vagus nerve activates
    the parasympathetic nervous system. \n\nIn 2010, research showed there was a positive
    feedback loop between high vagal tone, positive emotions, and good physical health.

  Title: When the vagus nerve is out of balance
  Image: 
  Description: "Your brain can become overstimulated, causing mental tension, anxiety
    and rumination. \n\n# Feelings Stressed and Overwhelmed \n\nWhen you are stressed
    and overwhelmed, you are more likely to become ill and are vulnerable to catching
    a cold or suffering from other illnesses related to the immune system. When the
    parasympathetic nervous system is active, it suppresses the immune response in
    your body. \n\n# Health problems and inflammation \n\nWhen the calming effects
    of the vagus nerve are inhibited through stress, your body can experience inflammation
    and this can lead to a range of health conditions. There is an extensive body
    of research that links inflammation to chronic health conditions. "

  Description: "Breathing is a tool that you can use to connect yourself with your
    body and restore balance to the underlying biological cause of your stress, tension
    and emotional distress. \n\nWhen you breathe deeply, your diaphragm presses against
    the vagus nerve. This nerve is responsible for sending impulses to your brain
    and signals to your mind it can relax. \n"

  Title: Movement and emotions
  Image: "/uploads/melody-jacob-IJcdUTz7AyM-unsplash.jpg"
  Description: |-
    When you experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected in your body as tension and discomfort.

    One of the ways you may manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into your mind. You probably don't realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to bring awareness to yourself in the present moment and reconnect with your body as a way to calm yourself and rebalance your mood.

    By dancing, stretching, exercising or going for a walk, you can bring your awareness into your body, which will help your mind to slow down and relax.

  Title: 'Yoga: Calming the body '
  Image: "/uploads/DeathtoStock_Fitness1.jpg"
  Description: "Yoga has been proven to have a range of benefits for mental health.
    Yoga works by reducing stress, relieving muscle tension and inflammation and calming
    the nervous system. \n\nThese physical benefits are correlated with improved attention
    and concentration and significant improvements in mood and relaxation. Yoga is
    beneficial for a range of distressing states, such as anxiety, depression and
    PTSD. \n\nA study followed 64 women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
    which is characterized by severe anxiety and fear following exposure to a traumatic
    event. After 10 weeks, 52% of participants no longer met the criteria for PTSD
    at all.  \n"

    Your relationship with your feelings and emotions has a significant impact on your wellbeing in your everyday life.

    Like the relationship with your body and mind, everybody has a unique relationship with their feelings and this relationship can change and evolve over time.

    By becoming more accepting and aware of your different feelings, it can help you to manage uncomfortable feelings more easily, develop stronger relationships with others and overcome challenging times in your life with more clarity and confidence.

  Title: Emotional Awareness
  Image: "/uploads/emotions%202.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Emotional awareness is the ability to observe, name and express what you are feeling.

    Emotional communication depends on this awareness and enables you to share your experiences more richly and accurately with others.

    By developing this ability to listen to what your feelings are telling you, you can help yourself to resolve misunderstandings with others, understand your reactions and your personal experience more clearly.

  Title: Emotional regulation
  Image: 
  Description: "Emotional Regulation is a term used to describe your ability to process
    emotions and to tolerate uncomfortable emotions that you often avoid.  \n\nIf
    you are able to regulate your emotions you can build your resilience and cope
    with challenging situations more effectively.\n\nThe first step for regulating
    emotions is to become aware of what the different emotions feel like and to explore
    your relationship with them."

  Image: 
  Description: "\nThe first lesson in using your mind more effectively is to observe
    its tendency to become distracted by intruding thoughts. \n\nYour mind likes to
    comment on our experiences. It comments on everything, from how you are feeling,
    to what you think about other people and the experiences you have. \n\nThe mind
    is always changing because your mood is always changing. You run into problems
    with the mind when you begin to believe that everything you are thinking is the
    only experience that is possible. "

  Title: Understanding the nature of the mind 
  Image: 
  Description: "\nYou may not realise how much your mind and thoughts have an impact
    on how you are feeling. By bringing awareness to the nature of your mind and by
    understanding how to control its different aspects, you can dramatically improve
    the quality of your everyday life. \n\nThis part of the course is designed to
    teach you how to examine and gain more awareness of your mind and thought processes.\n\nThere
    is a tendency for the mind to become distracted, which makes you feel lost and
    unclear about what you want to focus on. \n\nTo train the mind, you must learn
    how to control our attention and bring balance to it’s different tendencies so
    that you can use the mind, instead of allowing yourself to become stuck in autopilot. "

  Title: 'Rumination '
  Image: "/uploads/rumination%204-7271b0.jpg"
  Description: "\nIn Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything
    that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms.
    One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress,
    Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.\n\nRumination happens when you become caught
    in a particular story about your life which limits your focus to repetitive thought
    patterns. \n\nHigh levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety
    and low mood. \n\nWhen you ruminate, you may feel trapped in your thinking and
    can’t see a way out. This makes you feel low and makes you believe that your thoughts
    are an accurate reflection of reality. But this is not the case. \n\nYour mind
    is just one part of your experience and you can use it in many different ways. "

  Description: "Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing your awareness to
    the present moment consciously and non-judgementally. \n\nOften, your thoughts
    become preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on your past or overanalysing
    your personal experiences. \n\nThrough mindfulness, you can ‘step back’, become
    attuned to your present moment experience and release the grip on your thoughts. "

    Mindsets are the belief patterns that influence how you think and behave in your everyday life. Some Mindsets/ beliefs are very unconscious to you, while others are more apparent in your lives. 

    Many of your Mindsets are formed in childhood and adolescence and you hold onto these throughout your life. By exploring your mindsets you can become aware of how they serve or limit you. By becoming aware of how they limit you, you can chose to let go of the resistance they create in your life.

  Title: 'Imagination '
  Image: "/uploads/imagine.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Whenever somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps you to imagine future possibilities. When you close our eyes and allow yourself to imagine something, it helps you to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening. 

    When you get stuck with a decision, it’s because you feel like you don’t know what the outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people you are having the problem with, you can also visualise other aspects that you can’t access when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one belief or potential situation.

    to find healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions on our own.\n\nLetter writing,
    or journaling has been found to be a really effective way to identify and process
    your emotional world. \n\nThis letter writing exercise is focused on expressing
    your emotions towards other people but you can also journal about your own thoughts
    and feelings to help you make sense of them. \n\nThe process works in a similar
    way to communicating with words, as you are externalising your distress which
    allows you to view it in a new way."

Our mental health isn’t just about our minds. It is a complex and fascinating interplay between our physical, emotional and psychological states.

 In this module you will learn about the mind-body connection and explore your relationship to the different states of self-awareness that are available to you.

By developing your understanding of the inter-relatedness of your body, feelings and mind, you will learn about mental health through a holistic lens and learn techniques that can enhance your wellbeing in your everyday life.
