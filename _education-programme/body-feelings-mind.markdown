  Description: "There is now a large body of research confirming that our mental and
    physical wellbeing are closely intertwined and dependent on each other. \nMind-body
    approaches to wellbeing focus on developing a balance between our emotional, psychological
    and physical wellbeing in a sustained and gradual way over time. \nThis model
    views healing and wellbeing as a consequence of our ability to take notice and
    develop awareness of how our body, feelings and mind respond in our daily life. "

  Title: 'How effective are mind-body techniques? '
  Image: 
  Description: "Mind body techniques have been shown to improve depression in both
    children and adults. \n\n\n129 Palestinian children and teenagers took part in
    a 10-week mind-body skills programme that included meditation, breathing techniques
    and self expression through drawings and movement.  After the programme the participants
    reported feeling significantly less feelings of hopelessness ( a common experience
    in depression) \n\nThe young people experienced improvements in their depression
    after 7 months, despite continuing to live through conflict and adversity.  \n\nStaples,
    Atti, and Gordon (2011)\n\nFurthere research has shown that mind-body techniques
    have led to reduced mind-body rigidity and enable higher levels of awareness,
    motivation and improvements in mood and behaviour.  \n\nLin et al. (2010),\n\n"

  Title: Why is interoception important for mental health?
  Image: 
  Description: "\n\nInteroception is a skill that allows us to perceive our internal
    states and sensations of our body, feelings and mind.   It is a skill that provides
    us with a starting point for regulating our moods, thoughts and physical health.
    \n\nBy bringing awareness to the state of our body, feelings and mind, through
    the process of interoception, we can reduce the intensity of the distress and
    discomfort that we experience. \n\nWhen we turn towards our discomfort, with an
    attitude of curiosity and acceptance, we begin to develop the ability to regulate
    and reduce it.\n\n"

  Title: VAGUS NERVE
  Image: 
  Description: "Breathing is a tool that we can use to connect us with our bodies
    and restore balance to the underlying biological cause of stress, tension and
    emotional distress. \n\nWhen we breathe deeply, our diaphragm presses against
    the main nerve in our nervous system called the vagus nerve. This nerve is responsible
    for sending impulses to the brain that tells our mind it can relax. \n\nWhen the
    vagus nerve is not activated enough, our brain can become overstimulated, causing
    mental tension, anxiety and rumination. \n\nThe vagus nerve is the part of our
    body that is responsible for a large part of the mind-body connection. \n\nWe
    notice the effect of the vagus nerve when we do things that relieve physical tension
    and our minds become more relaxed and focused. \n\nThe vagus nerve sends messages
    between our internal body parts and our brain, sending messages back and forth
    that affect the functioning of our physical body and mental states."

  Description: "Experiencing a Threat \n\nWhen we experience a threat, the vagus nerve
    sends a message to our digestive system to stop producing digestive enzymes and
    to stop ourselves feeling hungry so that we can focus our energy and resources
    on responding to the threat around us. This is why when we feel stressed and anxious,
    we feel butterflies in our stomach and other uncomfortable feelings in our belly. 
    \n\nFeelings Stressed and Overwhelmed \n\nWhen we are stressed and overwhelmed,
    we are more likely to become ill and are vulnerable to catching a cold or suffering
    from other illnesses related to the immune system. When the parasympathetic nervous
    system is active, it suppresses the immune response in the body. \n\nHealth problems
    and inflammation \n\nWhen the calming effects of the vagus nerve are inhibited
    through stress, our body can experience inflammation and this can lead to a range
    of health conditions. There is an extensive body of research that links inflammation
    to chronic health conditions. Stress impairs functioning of the nervous system
    which produces this inflammation and therefore it is important to use the body's
    natural mechanism - breathing, to maintain balance and bring the balance of the
    body back to its healthy state. "

  Title: Movement and emotions
  Image: 
  Description: "When we experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected
    in our body as tension and discomfort. We can release this tension and discomfort
    by bringing awareness to our body and physical experience.\n\nOne of the ways
    we manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into our minds. Often we
    don’t realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to
    bring awareness to ourselves in the present moment and reconnect with our bodies
    as a way to calm ourselves and rebalance our mood. \n\nDance movement psychotherapy
    is effective because it allows us to learn how this process works as it allows
    us to experience the power of how we can use our bodies to influence our mood
    and release trapped and difficult emotions. \n\n\n"

  Title: 'Yoga as a method for integrating the mind and body '
  Image: 
  Description: "Yoga has been proven to have a range of benefits for mental health.
    \n\nYoga works by reducing stress, relieving muscle tension and inflammation and
    calming the nervous system. \n\nThese physical benefits are correlated with improved
    attention and concentration and significant improvements in mood and relaxation.
    \ \n\nYoga is beneficial for a range of distressing states, such as anxiety, depression
    and PTSD. \n\nA study followed 64 women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
    which is characterized by severe anxiety and fear following exposure to a traumatic
    event.\nAfter 10 weeks, 52% of participants no longer met the criteria for PTSD
    at all.  \n(Van der Kolk, 2014) "

  Title: Feelings
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Our relationship to our feelings and emotions has a significant impact on our wellbeing in our everyday life. Like our relationship to our body and mind, everybody has a unique relationship with their feelings and this relationship can change and evolve over time.

    By bringing awareness to our relationship to our feelings, it can help us to manage our difficult feelings more easily, develop stronger relationships with others and overcome challenging times with more clarity and confidence. 

    Emotional awareness is the ability to observe, name and express what we are feeling. Emotional communication depends on this awareness and enables us to share our experiences more richly and accurately with others. By developing this ability we can help ourselves to resolve misunderstandings with others, understand our reactions and find meaning in our experiences.

  Description: "Drawing is a powerful tool for getting in touch with our emotional
    world. Often if our lives are busy and we are very caught in our thoughts, it
    can be difficult to step back and observe how our feelings and emotions are. If
    our feelings get trapped or ignored it can contribute to a lot of tension and
    discomfort. This activity allows you to gently connect with your feelings in a
    therapeutic way, using a simple drawing exercise. This activity can be used alone
    or in groups to calm your mind and allow you to express the emotions you are carrying
    in any given moment. \n\nAs you do this exercise, memories and associations may
    emerge related to your feelings. This is completely normal and a part of what
    happens when you become attuned to your emotional world. Just allow this process
    to unfold and stay with whatever feelings and sensations emerge for you as you
    do the exercise. \n"

  Title: Emotional regulation
  Image: 
  Description: Emotional Regulation is a term used to describe our ability to process
    emotions and to tolerate uncomfortable emotions that we often avoid. If we are
    able to regulate our emotions we can build our resilience and cope with challenging
    situations more effectively.

  Title: 'LETTER WRITING AND EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    We often rely on relationships with other people to help us regulate our emotions but in the absence of these supportive environments it is important that we find healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions on our own. 

    Letter writing, or journaling has been found to be a really effective way to identify and process our emotional world. This letter writing exercise is focused on expressing our emotions towards other people but we can also journal about our own thoughts and feelings to help us make sense of them. This process works in a similar way to communicating with words, as we are externalising our distress which allows us to view it in a new way.

  Title: Observing the Tendency of the Mind to Distraction and Learning to still the
    mind
  Image: 
  Description: |2-


    The first lesson in using the mind is to observe its tendency to become distracted by intruding thoughts. 

    By eliminating distractions, you will be able to observe the mind with greater clarity. We will start with simple exercises to help you understand this. 

    Our mind likes to comment on our experiences. It comments on everything, from how we are feeling, to what we think about other people and the experiences we have. When we say we feel like ‘changing our mind’ it is because the feelings that we are having are causing us to have different thoughts about the same situation. The mind is always changing because our moods are always changing. We run into problems with the mind when we begin to believe that everything we are thinking is the only experience that is possible.

  Title: Understanding the nature of the mind 
  Image: 
  Description: |2-

    Often, we do not realise how much our mind and thoughts have an impact on how we are feeling. By bringing awareness to the nature of our mind and by understanding how to control its different aspects, we can dramatically improve the quality of our lives. 

    This part of the course is designed to teach you how to examine and gain more awareness of your mind and thought processes.

    There is a tendency for the mind to become distracted, which makes us feel lost and unclear about what we want to focus on. To train the mind, we must learn how to control our attention and bring balance to it’s different tendencies so that we can use the mind, instead of allowing ourselves to become stuck in autopilot.

  Title: 'RUMINATION '
  Image: 
  Description: "\nIn Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything
    that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms.
    One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress,
    Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.\n\nRumination happens when we become caught
    in a particular story about our lives which limits our focus to repetitive thought
    patterns. \n\nHigh levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety
    and low mood. \n\nWhen we ruminate, we often feel trapped in our thinking and
    can’t see a way out. This makes us feel low and makes us believe that our life
    is our thoughts. But this is not the case. Our mind is just one part of our experience
    and we can use it in many different ways. "

  Description: "Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing our awareness to
    the present moment consciously and non-judgementally. \nOften, our thoughts become
    preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on our past or overanalysing
    our personal experiences. \nThrough mindfulness, we can ‘step back’ and become
    attuned to our present moment experience. "

  Title: The rational mind
  Image: 
  Description: |2-


    When you create from the rational mind, things seem very factual and concrete. This is really helpful for answering questions and providing information for other people to understand. You can use your rational mind to convey your thoughts in a way that is simple and clear.

    The rational mind is also really helpful for communicating things you have already learned and want to tell to others. This is why people often get into arguments when they use their rational mind because they are communicating different things that they understand but not considering other possibilities with their imagination.

  Title: 'GETTING STUCK IN THE RATIONAL '
  Image: 
  Description: |2-

    Sometimes the rational mind can get so caught up in facts and information that we already know or want to understand that we forget to use our imagination to consider how it can be used in other ways and also how other people have made sense of the information from their own perspective.

    Everybody has a different perspective and so information can seem very different to different people. The way that you interpret the information depends on who is teaching you, your experiences of the information before and what you want to use the information to do. If you want to use the information to add to your beliefs about something then this means that you will often learn the information in a way that serves your beliefs, rather than in a way that can be discussed and changes over time.

  Title: 'The creative mind and problem solving '
  Image: 
  Description: "We can use our mind to come up with ideas and to create insights that
    can help us to make decisions more easily. How do we enable this part of the mind
    to work? \n\nOften, this is the part of the mind that we are not encouraged to
    use as much, so it can take a bit of practice to remind ourselves of what it feels
    like to use this part of the mind. This part of the mind is much softer and it
    enjoys working in ways that are more imaginative, like storytelling. \n\nWhenever
    somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along
    with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps us to imagine
    future possibilities and helps us to access parts of our experience we have not
    yet seen. When we close our eyes and allow ourselves to imagine something, it
    helps us to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening. \n\nWhen
    we get stuck with a decision, it’s because we feel like we don’t know what the
    outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people
    we are having the problem with, we can visualise other aspects that we can’t access
    when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one
    belief or potential situation.  "
