  Description: "Anxiety is a natural response to feelings of fear.\n\nThis fear response
    is a natural defence mechanism that manifests in the way we think, feel and behave.
    \n\nAnxiety can help us by making us alert us to potential threats and dangerous
    situations. For example if we are walking down an unfamiliar road late at night,
    it is very natural to feel edge, nervous and to consider the potential risks. "

  Title: When anxiety becomes a problem
  Image: 
  Description: "Anxiety becomes a problem in our lives when we begin to notice a reduced
    ability to cope with situations in our everyday life.\n\nIf we have experienced
    a situation in the past that we have not processed, it can cause us to feel like
    we can’t manage or cope in the present. \n\nThis is because our threat detector,
    or ‘smoke alarm’ becomes overactive and responds more sensitively to things we
    may not normally perceive as threatening."

  Title: 'The neuroscience of anxiety '
  Image: 
  Description: "The anxiety response begins in a part of the brain called the Amygdala.
    We share this part of the brain with all animals, as it is one of the most fundamental
    survival systems that allows us to detect threats in our environment. \n\nAnimal
    studies have shown that if you remove the amygdala, the animal loses any sense
    of fear or anxiety. \n \nThe amygdala is activated in response to situations of
    fear and uncertainty. Once activated, this part of the brain sends a message through
    the vagus nerve to activate our parasympathetic nervous system. "

  Description: "The size of the amygdala has been shown to correlate with people’s
    sensitivity to aspects of the environment they consider as threatening or unsafe.\n
    \ \nThis is believed to be caused by past experiences of stress and fear that
    causes the brain to adapt to become more alert to future instances of threat so
    that we can recognise them more easily.\n\nResearch has shown that mindfulness
    and stress reduction programmes reduce the size of the amygalda and people’s levels
    of anxiety in situations previously experienced as threatening. The size of the
    amygdala is correlated with the degree to which people subjectively experience
    the world as safe or threatening. "

  Description: "The vagus nerve causes a response in the heart, lungs and gut, which
    is triggered by a release of adrenaline and cortisol, two hormones that are connected
    with the threat response. \n\nThis causes our heart to beat faster, our breathing
    to become more shallow and a sensation of ‘butterflys in the stomach’. \n\nThe
    higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol cause us to feel nervous and jittery
    as they are preparing us to escape the threat (Flight) or become defensive to
    \ it ( Fight). The anxiety response is closely linked with the Freeze response,
    where we feel paralysed to act in the face of a threat. "

  Title: 'The freeze response '
  Image: 
  Description: "When fighting or running seems impossible or because the threat seems
    too powerful, our brain triggers a ‘Freeze Response’ that can feel very difficult
    to break out of.   \n\nFor example, if you have an upcoming test and you feel
    overwhelmed, you may feel paralysed and ‘frozen’ and unable to cope.  \n\nYou
    may feel feelings of numbness, detachment and dissociation which is caused by
    your brain separating you from the unpleasantness and strength of your emotions.
    \ \n\nYou may also feel overwhelmed, a sense of stiffness or a feeling of holding
    your breath. "

    # Anxious thought patterns

    One of those ways to notice if we are experiencing anxiety is to bring awareness to our thought patterns. When we are fearful and anxious, we begin to think differently, bringing awareness to these can help us recognise when we are caught in anxiety.

    # Tunnel Vision

    Focusing only only the negative aspects of our experience and ignoring the positive.

    # Catastrophising

    Expecting the worst case scenario to happen.

    # Mind reading and fortune telling

    Assuming you know what other people are thinking and often assuming other people’s perceptions of us are or will be negative.

    # Emotional reasoning

    Assuming that because we feel strongly towards a situation it must be the only reflection of how things are.

  Title: 'The Default mode network '

  Description: "Neuroscientists have identified a distinct neural network in the brain
    that is activated when we ruminate called the ‘Default Mode Network’ . \n\nWhen
    the ‘Default Mode’ Network is active, it may look like nothing is happening from
    the outside but actually inside our minds, we will be daydreaming, reflecting
    or thinking about our lives. \n\nThe default mode is active when we are worrying
    or preoccupied with thoughts about the past and future. "

  Title: 'Rumination '
  Image: 
  Description: "\nWhen we imagine an aspect of a future situation that we feel we
    can’t cope with, our mind tries to solve the problem by thinking about it. This
    can cause a ‘Thought Loop’ that is caused by our thoughts triggering more feelings
    of stress and anxiety, that in turn fuel more thoughts and stronger emotions.
    \n\nThis process of overthinking in relation to a real or imagined future scenario
    that we perceive as threatening, is called ‘ Rumination’. \n\nThe word comes from
    the word ‘ruminate’ which is the continued chewing motion that animals use to
    digest their food. We can think of rumination as the process of ‘ chewing on our
    thoughts’. \n\nResearch has shown that people who ruminate more are more likely
    to struggle with anxiety and depression. This makes sense, as the more our minds
    focus on problems, the more we will feel stuck and unable to change them. \n\n\n "

  Title: 'What are the long term effects of anxiety? '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    # Inability to concentrate 


    When the anxiety response is active, being in survival mode shuts down the activity of the prefrontal cortex which is required for focused attention.

    # Insomnia

    The hypervigilance caused by anxiety prevents the body from being in a state of relaxation which interrupts the functioning of our circadian rhythms.

    # Loss of memory

    As with concentration, our memory systems are temporarily impaired by anxiety due to the activity of cortisol that is released in the brain during the anxiety response.

    # Social Isolation

    Anxiety causes us to avoid situations that may threaten our sense of safety. We often feel anxiety around social situations if we do not feel  comfortable enough to interact with others, leading to a loop of avoidance and social isolation.

    # Weakened immune system

    The prolonged activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and continued release of cortisol into our bloodstream suppresses our body's natural immune response.
     
    # Muscle tension and fatigue 
     
    The adrenaline and cortisol released in the fight/flight/ freeze response causes the body to tense up as a way of protecting against injury and pain.

    but in the long term can perpetuate feelings of anxiety as it reinforces our internal
    beliefs that we cannot cope with situations that challenge us. "

  Description: "Paul Gilbert, an Evolutionary Psychologist has proposed that people
    feel anxiety as a response to social comparison, as people are hardwired to pay
    attention to their social status within groups. \n\nThis can cause us to feel
    fear related to social situations, like the fear of rejection or not being accepted
    by others. \n\nAs one of our primary needs is a sense of belonging, connection
    and acceptance, our threat system becomes active when we perceive a threat to
    our attachment needs for love and belonging."

    mechanism to tell us something is wrong.\n\nIf we are experiencing a conflict

  Description: |-
    Emotional regulation is a really important tool for getting unstuck a loop of fearful thoughts and feelings. By understanding how emotional regulation works we can develop our self awareness and gain more control over the different states of mind we experience. 

    Paul Gilbert described 3 main aspects of our emotional regulation system. We will always be experiencing at least one of these states and our wellbeing depends on us experiencing a healthy balance between all 3.

    Each state corresponds to an area in our brain responsible for either survival (Threat), bonding and relaxation (Soothing)  or motivation and reward (Drive).

  Title: Exercise

  Description: |-
    When we worry, our minds sends signals to our body that there is a still a potential threat that exists and the triggers our body to release the stress hormone cortisol, which makes us feel jittery and tense if not reduced.


    Exercise is beneficial for anxiety as it reduces levels of cortisol and increases our endorphins which improve our mood.


    Research has shown that 5 minutes of exercise can begin to reduce our levels of anxiety.

  Title: 'Activating the Task Positive Network '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    The Default mode is switched OFF when we focus our attention on tasks or ‘doing things’. When we are in this mode, our ‘ Task Positive Network’ is activated. We can see this network as the ‘solution focused network.’ These networks are similar to a switch, when one is ON the other is OFF. 

    This explains why we find it much more difficult to worry about a problem when we choose to go for a walk, when we go to meet our friends or when we are doing something that takes our attention away from the problem.

    If you experience a lot of worry, you can strengthen your Task Positive Network by adding particular tasks to your daily routine that ensure you spend less time in your mind ruminating about your fears and anxieties.

  Description: |-
    ### Diet a diet that stabilises your blood sugar

    If your blood sugar is low, it triggers the stress response which makes you more likely to feel anxiety.

    ### Speaking about it

    Research shows that when we form connections with other people, we are reducing cortisol in the body. Our parasympathetic nervous system is turned off when we feel safe and supported.

    ### Sleep - at least 8 hours

    Sleep is designed to reduce stress levels as it allows you to release the resistance that causes anxiety. Your fight or fight response is triggered when you do not get enough sleep.
