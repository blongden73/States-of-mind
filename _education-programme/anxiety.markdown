  Title: When anxiety becomes a problem
  Image: 
  Description: "Anxiety becomes a problem if you begin to notice a reduced ability
    to cope with situations in your everyday life.\n\nIf you have experienced a situation
    in the past that you have not processed, it can cause you to feel like you can’t
    manage or cope with present challenges. \n\nThis is because your threat detector,
    or ‘smoke alarm’ becomes overactive and responds more sensitively to things you
    may not normally perceive as threatening."

  Title: 'The neuroscience of anxiety '
  Image: 
  Description: "The anxiety response begins in a part of your brain called the Amygdala.
    The amygdala is activated in response to situations of fear and uncertainty.\n\nYou
    share this part of the brain with all animals, as it is one of the most fundamental
    survival systems that allows you to detect threats in your environment. \n\nAnimal
    studies have shown that if you remove the amygdala, the animal loses any sense
    of fear or anxiety. "

    vagus nerve to activate our parasympathetic nervous system ( The fight or flight
    response). \n\nThe size of your amygdala has been shown to correlate with your
    sensitivity to aspects of your environment you consider as threatening or unsafe.\n
    \ \nResearch has shown that mindfulness and stress reduction programmes reduce
    the size of the amygdala and people’s levels of anxiety in situations they previously
    experienced as threatening. "

  Title: 'Rumination '
  Image: "/uploads/rumination%202.jpeg"
  Description: "\nWhen you imagine an aspect of a future situation that you feel you
    can’t cope with, your mind tries to solve the problem by thinking about it. This
    can cause a ‘Thought Loop’ that is caused by your thoughts triggering more feelings
    of stress and anxiety, that in turn fuel more thoughts and stronger emotions.
    \n\nThis process of overthinking is called ‘ Rumination’. \n\nThe word comes from
    the word ‘ruminate’ which is the continued chewing motion that animals use to
    digest their food. You can think of rumination as the process of ‘chewing on our
    thoughts’. \n\nResearch has shown that people who ruminate more are more likely
    to struggle with anxiety and depression. \n\n "

    brain that is activated when you ruminate called the ‘Default Mode Network’ .
    \n\nWhen your ‘Default Mode’ Network is active, it may look like nothing is happening
    from the outside but actually inside your mind, you will be daydreaming, reflecting
    or thinking about your life. \n\nThe default mode is active when you are worrying
    or preoccupied with thoughts about the past and future. "

    When you are fearful and anxious, you begin to think differently. Bringing awareness to these thought patterns can help you recognise when you are caught in anxiety.

    # Tunnel Vision

    Focusing only only the negative aspects of your experience and ignoring the positive.

    # Catastrophising

    Expecting the worst case scenario to happen.

    # Mind reading and fortune telling

    Assuming you know what other people are thinking and often assuming other people’s perceptions of you are or will be negative.

    # Emotional reasoning

    Assuming that because you feel strongly towards a situation it must be the only reflection of how things are.

  Description: "The vagus nerve causes a response in your heart, lungs and gut, which
    is triggered by a release of adrenaline and cortisol, two hormones that are connected
    with the threat response. \n\nThis causes your heart to beat faster, your breathing
    to become more shallow and a sensation of ‘butterflys in the stomach’. \n\nThe
    higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol cause you to feel nervous and jittery
    as they are preparing you to escape the threat (Flight) or become defensive to
    \ it ( Fight). The anxiety response is closely linked with the Freeze response,
    where you feel paralysed to act in the face of a threat. "

  Title: 'The freeze response '
  Image: 
  Description: "When fighting or running seems impossible or because the threat seems
    too powerful, your brain triggers a ‘Freeze Response’ that can feel very difficult
    to break out of.   \n\nFor example, if you have an upcoming test and you feel
    overwhelmed, you may feel paralysed and ‘frozen’ and unable to cope.  \n\nYou
    may feel feelings of numbness, detachment and dissociation which is caused by
    your brain separating you from the unpleasantness and strength of your emotions.
    \ \n\nYou may also feel overwhelmed, a sense of stiffness or a feeling of holding
    your breath. "

  Title: 'What are the long term effects of anxiety? '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    # Inability to concentrate 


    When the anxiety response is active, being in survival mode shuts down the activity of your prefrontal cortex which is required for focused attention.

    # Insomnia

    The hypervigilance caused by anxiety prevents your body from being in a state of relaxation which interrupts the functioning of our circadian rhythms.

    # Loss of memory

    As with concentration, your memory system is temporarily impaired by anxiety due to the activity of cortisol that is released in your brain during the anxiety response.

    # Social Isolation

    Anxiety may cause you to avoid situations that may threaten our sense of safety. You often feel anxiety around social situations if you do not feel  comfortable enough to interact with others, leading to a loop of avoidance and social isolation.

    # Weakened immune system

    The prolonged activation of the parasympathetic nervous system and continued release of cortisol into your bloodstream suppresses your body's natural immune response.
     
    # Muscle tension and fatigue 
     
    The adrenaline and cortisol released in the fight/flight/ freeze response causes your body to tense up as a way of protecting against injury and pain.

    retreat into avoidant behaviours that make you feel comfortable and secure rather
    than risking potential scenarios that could cause you more stress. \n\nThe tendency
    to avoid situations that could cause you discomfort can help in the short term
    but in the long term can perpetuate feelings of anxiety as it reinforces your
    internal beliefs that you cannot cope with situations that challenge you. "

  Title: Anxiety and Social Rank Theory 
  Image: 
  Description: "Paul Gilbert, an Evolutionary Psychologist has proposed that people
    feel anxiety as a response to social comparison, as people are hardwired to pay
    attention to their social status within groups. \n\nThis can cause you to feel
    fear related to social situations, like the fear of rejection or not being accepted
    by others. \n\nAs one of your primary needs is a sense of belonging, connection
    and acceptance, your threat system becomes active when you perceive that your
    attachment needs for love and belonging are threatened."

  Image: 
  Description: |-
    The key to managing anxiety is to address the underlying cause of your fear response. This part of the module will explore how you can do that by:

    Exploring your fears and limiting beliefs

    Reducing the stress response and activating your ‘soothing system’

    Over-riding rumination by activating your Task Positive Network

    Changing your state of mind from a need to control, to a state of acceptance and self compassion.

  Title: 'Emotional Regulation '
  Image: "/uploads/elsa-t-BlGFrdgpBqw-unsplash.jpg"
  Description: |-
    Emotional regulation is a really important tool for getting unstuck a loop of fearful thoughts and feelings. By understanding how emotional regulation works you can develop your self awareness and gain more control over the different states of mind you experience. 

    Paul Gilbert described 3 main aspects of your emotional regulation system. You will always be experiencing at least one of these states and your wellbeing depends on you experiencing a healthy balance between all 3.

    Each state corresponds to an area in your brain responsible for either survival (Threat), bonding and relaxation (Soothing)  or motivation and reward (Drive).

  Title: Exercise
  Image: "/uploads/flo-karr-zkctapwhzxc-unsplash.jpg"
  Description: |-
    When you worry, your minds sends signals to your body that there is a still a potential threat that exists and this triggers your body to release the stress hormone cortisol, which makes you feel jittery and tense.

    Exercise is beneficial for anxiety as it reduces levels of cortisol and increases your endorphins which improve your mood.

    Research has shown that 5 minutes of exercise can begin to reduce your levels of anxiety.

    When you practice slow and deep breathing, it activates your vagus nerve which sends a signal to the brain that tells your body to relax.

  Title: 'Activating the Task Positive Network '
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    Your Default mode is switched OFF when you focus your attention on tasks or ‘doing things’. When you are in this mode, your ‘Task Positive Network’ is activated. You can see this network as your ‘solution focused network.’ These networks are similar to a switch, when one is ON the other is OFF. 

    This explains why you find it much more difficult to worry about a problem when you choose to go for a walk, when you go to meet your friends or when you are doing something that takes your attention away from the problem.

    If you experience a lot of worry, you can strengthen your Task Positive Network by adding particular tasks to your daily routine that ensure you spend less time in your mind ruminating about your fears and anxieties.

  Description: "The anxiety response is kept going when you avoid your feelings through
    escaping to your mind (rumination). \n \nSelf compassion involves bringing your
    awareness to your discomfort and distress and understanding that your pain and
    suffering is a normal part of being human. \n\nBy bringing an attitude of care
    and acceptance towards yourself, you can focus our energy away from your worries
    and concerns, towards a dedicated attempt to reassure and support yourself. \n\nBy
    turning towards your feelings, instead of resisting them, you can begin to self
    soothe and calm your anxiety.    "

  Title: Other ways to reduce anxiety
  Image: 
  Description: |-
    ### Diet a diet that stabilises your blood sugar
    If your blood sugar is low, it triggers the stress response which makes you more likely to feel anxiety.

    ### Speaking about it
    Research shows that when we form connections with other people, we are reducing cortisol in the body. Our parasympathetic nervous system is turned off when we feel safe and supported.

    ### Sleep - at least 8 hours
    Sleep is designed to reduce stress levels as it allows you to release the resistance that causes anxiety. Your fight or fight response is triggered when you do not get enough sleep.
