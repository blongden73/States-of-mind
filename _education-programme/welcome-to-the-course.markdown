  Description: "The course has been designed to lead you through a process of self
    exploration, a journey in which your connection to your identity, body, feelings
    and mind will be explored in a compassionate and empathetic way. \n\nYou will
    have access to a personal digital handbook that is intended to cultivate and enhance
    your self awareness. \n\nAnd don't worry, everything you write in your handbook
    will be anonymous! We want you to think of it as a personal diary or self discovery
    journal. \n"

  Title: Resistance and Procrastination
  Image: 
  Description: "\nFeelings of resistance and the desire to procrastinate are inevitable
    feelings that will emerge as part of this work. \n\nIf you encounter these feelings,
    it is important that you begin to develop your ability to bring awareness, curiosity
    and an attitude of openness to them. \n\nThey are an important aspect of the work
    and if you encourage the exploration of these states, your work will deepen and
    your development will be enhanced. \n\n"
