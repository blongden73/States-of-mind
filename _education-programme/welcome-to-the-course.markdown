  Title: Resistance and Procrastination
  Image: 
  Description: "\nFeelings of resistance and the desire to procrastinate are inevitable
    feelings that will emerge as part of this work. \n\nIf you encounter these feelings,
    it is important that you begin to develop your ability to bring awareness, curiosity
    and an attitude of openness to them. \n\nThey are an important aspect of the work
    and if you encourage the exploration of these states, your work will deepen and
    your development will be enhanced. \n\n"
