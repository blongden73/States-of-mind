This programme has been designed to lead you through a process of self exploration, a journey in which your connection to your identity, body, feelings and mind will be investigated in a compassionate and empathetic way. You will have access to a personal handbook that is intended to cultivate and enhance your self awareness. It will guide you through an inner journey that will, like all journeys, entail roadblocks, crossroads, moments of confusion, clarity and inspiration.
