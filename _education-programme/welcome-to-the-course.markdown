  Description: "\nResistance and Procrastination\n\nFeelings of resistance and the
    desire to procrastinate are inevitable feelings that will emerge as part of this
    work. If you encounter these feelings, it is important that you begin to develop
    your ability to bring awareness, curiosity and an attitude of openness to them.
    They are an important aspect of the work and if you encourage the exploration
    of these states, your work will deepen and your development will be enhanced.

The course has been designed to lead you through a process of self exploration, a journey in which your connection to your identity, body, feelings and mind will be explored in a compassionate and empathetic way. You will have access to a personal handbook that is intended to cultivate and enhance your self awareness. **To save your work in your handbook, please create a username that does not contain your name, so that all of your work remains anonymous.** 

The purpose of this course is not only to achieve new states of wellbeing, but to explore your relationship with discomfort, uncertainty and resistance to change.  By working with discomfort, you will learn important personal patterns, mindsets and attitudes you have and relate to yourself with more openness and understanding.
