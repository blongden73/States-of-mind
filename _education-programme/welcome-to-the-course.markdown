  Description: "\nResistance and Procrastination\n\nFeelings of resistance and the
    desire to procrastinate are inevitable feelings that will emerge as part of this
    work. If you encounter these feelings, it is important that you begin to develop
    your ability to bring awareness, curiosity and an attitude of openness to them.
    They are an important aspect of the work and if you encourage the exploration
    of these states, your work will deepen and your development will be enhanced.

    wellbeing, but to develop your relationship with discomfort, uncertainty and resistance

    mindsets and attitudes you have and relate to yourself with more openness and
    understanding.
