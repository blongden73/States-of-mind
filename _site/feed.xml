In the busyness of modern life, rarely are we provided with safe spaces to step back and consciously reflect on our mental and emotional wellbeing. Without this ability to reflect and process the meaning in our everyday life and personal experience, we can easily become caught up in unhealthy unconscious behaviour and feel unfulfilled with how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest gifts of humankind is having the possibility to constantly reinvent yourself and to endlessly explore and learn about this collective human experience. As we develop a practice of self awareness, we can experience a richer life, we can allow deep healing and expand ourselves  by opening up space within us to establish meaning and foster change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-self-awareness&quot;&gt;What is self awareness?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self awareness is a human faculty that enables us to become observers of our own life journey. It allows us to witness – without judgement – our mental, emotional and physical states. Through self awareness, we can make sense of and process our human experience with the powerful gift of conscious attention. By developing this natural aptitude, we can learn to regulate the quality of our reality and access an empowering sense of freedom and choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insights we gain through self awareness can help to shape the life we want and motivate us to become the person we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when we can connect to our authenticity, we gain clarity around the changes we want to make to support ourselves and have more meaningful relationships. Without self awareness, we can become unconscious to our behaviours, repress our feelings and intuitions and often depart from living in alignment with our true values and best interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man is a social animal, as defined by Aristotle, and although our learning process is individual, there can also be value in others’ perception, essential to form a fuller sense of self. According to a study conducted by organisational therapist, researcher and New York Times bestselling author Tasha Eurich, there are two types of self awareness:
internal self awareness (how clearly we see ourselves, our own values, our own thought process, passions, aspirations, emotions and behaviours)
external self awareness (how other people view us and our place in the world).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Western societies, some of the most popular methods used to develop self awareness are creative processes, physical exercise, meditation, journaling and therapy. The list goes on but there’s no right way to ‘pay attention’ or be ‘self aware’ – your own journey is unique to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At States of Mind, we’re passionate about the benefits of self awareness, so we create safe spaces for young people to learn about and develop it for themselves.The teenage and young adult years are an ideal time to explore and nurture self awareness, allowing us to grow in a direction of our choice. We believe that by giving more people the opportunity to develop self awareness from a young age, they can learn to manage difficult experiences with more confidence and live significantly happier, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cultivating-self-awareness-5-of-our-tips&quot;&gt;Cultivating self awareness: 5 of our tips&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on the WHAT and not the WHY
This is essential to get started and to avoid unhealthy patterns and negative self talk. As you start reflecting on your journey so far and where you want to take it, you might feel moments of judgement towards yourself and the world around you. Observe, but don’t judge and focus on what it is you see instead of why it is as you see it. Be aware of rumination, which is a form of internal awareness linked to anxiety and depression where you focus on negative and painful stories around your past and present self.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take the time
Self awareness can become a habit that we value and enjoy. Most of us already have moments of self awareness throughout our days when we have a chat (to another person, or with ourselves) about our mental state, when take a big deep breath, or when we write in our journal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of developing self awareness becomes more powerful and sustainable when we set the time aside and feel committed to ourselves. Whether it’s a set time with a friend or a psychologist, a dedicated time to exercise or write, a day to take yourself on a date and reflect on your journey so far; set the time aside to develop self awareness and make it one of your healthy priorities. You may think that you have more important things to do, however look at it as a time investment that will eventually come back to you with a better life quality and feeling of authenticity in being yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a safe space
We often hear the phrase “safe space” or “create a space” and we may wonder, “What makes a space safe?” A safe space can be a physical space (a sanctuary of your own, a bedroom, an altar, a garden, a café you love, a journal) and also a mental space (a space inside yourself that you can find by closing your eyes, through meditation, relaxation, breathing techniques – somewhere you feel safe to hear your inner voice). Ideally, you should try to find both a physical sanctuary and a mental space. You can find some guidance in how to develop a self reflective practice with our next article in the journal. This is a guided method to get started on your self reflective practice that will lead you to your safe space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask questions
Get into the habit of checking in with yourself. Ask yourself a few times a day “How am I feeling right now?” Just sit with the question for a few moments, meditate on it, or write your immediate thoughts in a journal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be helpful to get external insight from those who know you. Identify some things about yourself that you would like more clarity on, and ask your friends, family members, psychologist, teachers their thoughts. It may seem counterintuitive to look to others for insight about yourself, but it can help to create a well-rounded perspective of yourself. But take a moment to imagine your awareness is a room. Naturally, you only have your own perception of this room, and the more you get another perspective, the more you’ll know it from all the different angles. There is no right or better angle, just a greater understanding of your own story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cultivate imagination and empathy
Self awareness allows you to become the observer of your thought process, of your mind, of your body and of the world around you. In short, it can help bring a different sense of consciousness and a greater attention to things in your life. But developing it takes time and effort, and so you want to have as many tools as possible to help you on this journey. Here are two of the key ones:
Imagination: Cultivate your imagination through creative practice, conversation with strangers, travelling and trying out new things.
Empathy: Self awareness enables us to live with greater compassion for ourselves and others. By recognising and bringing attention to the parts of ourselves that we sometimes judge, ignore or deny, we can build a stronger relationship with ourselves, connect more fully in our relationships and the things we do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we all share a collective human experience. Self awareness is a gift that can expand our understanding of what it means to be human, and to be on this wild ride called life, together.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oscar Wilde was right. A diary recalls one’s sensation from the past, present, and future, so it follows that it would always be a sensational read. Wilde humours his audience by hinting that his life was always more interesting than any character from a novel, and considering his biography and fantastic work of art, he was probably right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not all future Oscar Wildes and we may not have the ambition to write an impressive body of work in theatre, poetry and literature, but I’ll take a risk in suggesting that we may all share the ambition to grow and improve as human beings in our lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the art of self-reflection comes in. Writing a self-reflective journal is about being an active witness of your own experience. By taking a closer look at yourself, you can find clarity on who you were, who you are and who you wish to become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all encounter countless teachers in our life. Our first teachers are our parents, then our primary school teachers, our friends, our first boyfriends or girlfriends and the list goes on. But ultimately, the main teacher who remains with us our entire life is ourselves. By developing the habit of reflecting on and learning through our own experience, we become simultaneously the teacher and the student to our own self. With time and practice we can become our most reliable teacher. Once we learn to trust our instinct, we can reflect and analyse our experience and dare to share our dreams with our higher self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, a reflective practice is the habit of thinking and reflecting on what you do and who you are, and journaling can be an effective approach. There is no right or wrong way to write a journal, but below are some simple tips to help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;make-it-a-habit&quot;&gt;Make it a habit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it is everyday or every week, the regularity of your practice will help you create a safe space for your mind which can help you learn to trust yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dont-worry-just-write&quot;&gt;Don’t worry, just write&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try writing without an agenda, structure, or plan. Practice automatic writing, just letting whatever’s on your mind flow onto the page. Though you may have no idea what you’re writing, your subconscious will absorb the content and you may find that later on you come to a new realisation about yourself or something in your life. Let the process be intuitive: if you want to write the same sentence 10 times, do it; if you want to doodle for 10 minutes, do it. Trust your mind to take you where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;write-to-someone-else&quot;&gt;Write to someone else&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write as if you are addressing your inner child, your future self, or perhaps your best friend or a stranger. This can help make it easier to share information about your feelings and your deepest thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ask-questions&quot;&gt;Ask questions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know an answer on a decision you should make or whether something would be good for you to do? Write the question down, then leave it for a day or a week. When you return to it, try to answer with the first thing that comes to your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;focus-on-the-details&quot;&gt;Focus on the details&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are often told not to focus too much on details, but journaling is an amazing opportunity to do exactly that. Write to explore your experience in depth and insist on anything that caught your attention. Start with the five senses: what did you see, feel, smell, taste or hear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;read-and-reflect&quot;&gt;Read and reflect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid reading your words as you write them: choose a separate time to read your entries. At the end of your journaling session, or once a month, take the time to read what you wrote without judgment and note the evolution of your thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">“I never travel without my diary.

&lt;p&gt;States of Mind views mental health concerns in the context of young people’s lives and seeks to identify with young people, the causes of their distress. The purpose of this project was to provide young people with the opportunity to speak about their experiences in education and to use their voices to help inform at a policy level, new ways in which schools can create more psychologically healthy environments for students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was initiated in response to Ofsted’s consultation on their new Inspection Framework in January 2019. Ofsted Inspections have a significant influence on young people’s experience of education as it drives every school’s focus on academic attainment and exam performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the period of the consultation, 80 students have shared their views around their experience in education, exploring Ofsted’s influence on the culture of schools and the subsequent impact this has on student’s mental health and identity.The results expose a complex account of how the UK education system, under Ofsted’s current framework, is contributing to a decline in the mental health of students.  The working group have revealed an account, that provides a new context for understanding a factor contributing to the rising levels of mental health concerns experienced by young people. Student’s have summarised their findings in an open letter to Amanda Speilman, calling for their voices and experiences to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the Open Letter here. [links to Open Letter blog]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sharing from Julia, student working group member:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have been doing work experience with States of Mind for 10 weeks and I have learned a lot more not only about mental health but also how it fits in our society today.  States of Mind has allowed me to be able to see the bigger picture and feel like, for once, my opinion and the voices of other young people have been listened to and that they actually matter. I enjoyed every week and every activity that we did and I genuinely feel like all of it has a purpose and that it should become a much bigger deal and acknowledged by more people. I would recommend States of Mind to anyone who cares about the current system and who wants to learn more not just about the world but about themselves. The whole experience has been enjoyable and I have learnt skills that I will take with me for life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in the interest of parents, employers and society as a whole to advocate for an education system that enables young people to flourish as individuals, with unique skill sets, ambitions and confidence in speaking their views critically and truthfully with others. Yet often, young people’s experience of education feels limiting, minimising their sense of choice, personal identity and unique personal interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research project allowed young people to lead the conversation around their experience in education and explore the issues that most mattered to them. As the primary stakeholders of education, their voices are key to understanding the issues and proposing reforms that can enable a more engaging and fulfilling experience of learning and developing within school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of high stakes testing should not be underestimated. Students reported often feeling shamed by teachers and their families if they were unable to meet the academic requirements expected of them.  Meanwhile students are aware that non- academic routes will often suit their needs better and can even place them ahead of their peers in terms of access to employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students feel that often, the role of teachers seems to be to teach to the test, rather than fostering supportive relationships that allow them to explore and uncover their personal ambitions and interests. Students recognise the stress placed on teachers,  which reduces their sense of being able to ask for help, for fear that the mindset they will receive is that they are not ‘good students’. Schools, with increasing pressure to obtain academic results from their students, often respond to mental health problems in a reactive way- responding to students in crisis, feeling unable to offer the care and support that is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings from the young people’s work so far illustrate how young people want to be seen as individuals, with individual needs and unique ambitions. Ofsted inspections focus school’s targets on Academic performance, rather than their ability to provide a holistic and student focused culture of general wellbeing and self determination. There is a stigma around non academic pathways and alternative routes to employment which frames less academic students as having ‘failed ‘ the ‘ true test of intelligence’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research the student’s have initiated continues to develop with States of Mind recently collaborating with UCL to develop the research base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about our work is collaborating with inspiring young people from all over London. In our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme, we teach secondary school and college age students about mental health and emotional intelligence, provide a space for them to explore their mind, behaviour and identity, and hear their ideas for how their learning environment could be a happier, healthier place. Then we help turn those ideas into reality, as students use what they’ve learned to design and run an initiative to improve wellbeing at their school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first part of our new series of interviews with students in the programme, we speak with Neeraja, who was part of the first cohort of Wellbeing Ambassadors in Newham Borough. As project manager for the team, she oversaw the development of not one but two new wellbeing initiatives for her college. (We think that’s pretty great).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her team designed and co-facilitated peer talking groups for wellbeing which were run as lunchtime drop in sessions and in tutorials, as well as launching the Nameless Book, an opportunity for students across her college to submit stories about what they learned from overcoming challenging experiences in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down together to hear her thoughts on the experience and find out how the projects went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From starting the wellbeing ambassadors programme, to the end, what changes have you noticed in yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the programme started, I was pretty open about discussing mental health and making other people aware of it. But I’ve realised that I’ve gained more confidence in talking about it since becoming a wellbeing ambassador. After the training, I felt like I had more authority to talk about [mental health], I felt as if I was more aware and that I could actually talk about it with confidence. It also really helped me build my leadership, communication and active listening skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is that what you expected when you started?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly didn’t expect anything when I came into it, I knew that it was something that I was passionate about so I felt like if I could do anything to help that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What impact has the experience had on your understanding of mental health?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme definitely helped improve my understanding of mental health, and helped me see mental health with a different perspective. All I had known about mental health was through my education as I had done Psychology for GCSE’s, so my knowledge was more educational rather than practical. So when I started the programme I started to understand how mental health is [a part of real life], not just how it is written down in books or how it is described in medical terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also helped me develop a perception of it, I could see how different people in college and other wellbeing ambassadors viewed mental health and what their opinions were, not just my own. It was really a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has talking about mental health been useful for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes it has, it has been very useful, personally and also for everyone else. I think we have definitely created an impact in college because we have started a chain of people talking about mental health, whereas beforehand it wasn’t nearly as big a focus as it should have been. Even though it is a tiny change, we have changed the way people think about mental health at our college. I really think we have made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What potential do you see the programme having?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely see the programme improving and growing over the next few years, and more people joining. I would like to see more wellbeing ambassadors, male and female, and would like to see the changes that we started continued. I’m really looking forward to [our project’s] book and the group support sessions. They have been very successful which is really great and we have had pretty positive reviews from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could you tell me a bit about the group support session that you ran and what that was like for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well at the start there was this awkwardness and nobody knew how to start talking, but once people started talking everyone was really open. We were talking about the different fears we have, like the fears around safeguarding, how there have been knife attacks. We talked about some of the main issues, like how there has been crime in Newham and everything and we started to hear, it wasn’t just us but so many other people were impacted by it on a more personal level actually. Even the tutors, there were two tutors with us, even they had similar experiences to us and we started to see that the adults who we see as different to us are not as different as we think. They basically have the same experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some students who still had trouble opening up completely but I think that if they keep coming to the support sessions it would actually be a really nice space for them. We also found out that other students in college feel alone and lonely, as if they have no friends there, and for them we realised it would be such a great opportunity, because it’s like a new friendship group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was it like to co-facilitate the group?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start we wanted to make people feel safe with us, because we didn’t want them to feel like we were in charge of them or like we were conducting an interview or something. So we started talking about our own experiences. Tisha and I started sharing our own experiences and how we were feeling and they started to realise it wasn’t us against them, more like ‘we are all in this together’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good, it was fun. I mean, there were times when we completely ran out of ideas but it always somehow came naturally to us, like we would get a bit stuck and unsure of what to talk about next but then somebody else would start talking and we would realise, ‘OK wait, we don’t need to do anything, it will take care of itself’, it was so organic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what’s great is you now have those skills and you can take them to other places. If you wanted to take that to university, you could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah it would be great if we could continue with it somehow. Tisha and I are both going to university and so we could each take it with us. It would be great, like a chain that we started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you think this approach to raising awareness about mental health could impact schools and other educational settings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the approach we took is more friendly – instead of a psychologist and the patient dynamic, it’s more like two people having a conversation. I think this helps because in school I’ve noticed that when people mention mental health, it’s more like you’re crazy, that’s the way that they see it. But I think our approach would raise the awareness that is necessary to eradicate those kinds of perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think it can help the teacher student relationship immensely, in the way that we deal with mental health. I think teachers should be able to deal with it in the way we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what you were saying about the support groups and the tutors being there, it’s as if you have already started to change those relationships?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, because through some of the talks, we realised that the tutors also go through problems like us and they are not completely strangers to this. You know, there’s this whole idea that teachers won’t understand what we are going through. I think projects like this would take away that idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for your school to have brought the programme in this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it should have been brought out earlier to be honest. If it had been brought out last year I definitely would have been more involved and I’m kind of sad that I won’t be getting another year. It is such a great programme and I think it will really help change a lot of student’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

Then we help turn those ideas into reality, as students use what they’ve learned to design and run an initiative to improve wellbeing at their school. In the first part of our new series of interviews with students in the programme, we speak with Neeraja, who was part of the first cohort of Wellbeing Ambassadors in Newham Borough. As project manager for the team, she oversaw the development of not one but two new wellbeing initiatives for her college. (We think that’s pretty great). Her team designed and co-facilitated peer talking groups for wellbeing which were run as lunchtime drop in sessions and in tutorials, as well as launching the Nameless Book, an opportunity for students across her college to submit stories about what they learned from overcoming challenging experiences in their lives. We sat down together to hear her thoughts on the experience and find out how the projects went.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Vulnerability isn’t a weakness, it’s a strength</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/journal/2020/05/20/vulnerability-isnt-a-weakness-its-a-strength.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vulnerability isn’t a weakness, it’s a strength" /><published>2020-05-20T11:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-20T11:38:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/journal/2020/05/20/vulnerability-isnt-a-weakness-its-a-strength</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/journal/2020/05/20/vulnerability-isnt-a-weakness-its-a-strength.html">&lt;p&gt;I used to assume that every action we took, every word we spoke and every time we felt an instant connection towards someone, there would always be a consequence. This sense of paranoia and lack of trust in anyone helped to build a mental link between “vulnerable” and “not capable of doing something substantial for people who were important to me.” I assumed that this was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last year, I spoke with a group of young people who talked about vulnerability being the pinpoint explanation for someone struggling with their mental health. I thought about my environment at school, and how vulnerability is seen as a weak attribute there. This means it’s difficult for male students to express their own emotions because they don’t want others to see them as vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, I’ve learned how important it is to have a connection with other people. According to Brené Brown, connection brings meaning and purpose to our lives. People who live in shame and fear are ultimately afraid of being disconnected with people around them, which leads them to ask, ‘Am I worthy of connection?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By avoiding showing others your imperfections or flaws, you can also avoid feelings of vulnerability. Maybe this is why men can feel forced to hide their shame – as a way to avoid vulnerability in certain circumstances. But to create a connection with another person, you need to open with each other, embrace your flaws, and be willing to share them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to enhance our connection with others, we need to seek out and foster courage, compassion and confidence – the kind that inspires everyone. I feel that being vulnerable can be perceived as a negative concept, but it’s also very positive. Being vulnerable allows us to relate to one another, because we all have imperfections in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our society, we often expect males to be powerful, strong and not ‘to cry’ in the most tragic times. But these are outdated societal norms, and we in the 21st century have so much freedom. Women are gaining more rights and security, the gender pay gap is getting smaller and the LGBTQ+IA community is becoming freer than ever. These progressions have come from actions people have taken to transform society for the better. So why is it that we still assume that men shouldn’t show emotion or vulnerability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue affects everyone, not only men. It’s time to understand that it’s okay to be vulnerable, because vulnerability connects us to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I used to assume that every action we took, every word we spoke and every time we felt an instant connection towards someone, there would always be a consequence.
