<p>Consider other times in your life when you noticed that you were not really mentalising but mind reading. Think about what was happening in the situation. 
The most important aspect of mentalizing is being genuinely curious about another person’s experience.  It is important that you do not pretend to act curious or it will not truly be mentalizing.</p>

<p>Think of a scenario that currently exists in your life, where a friend, family member or somebody else that you know is acting in a way that is causing you frustration or a sense of disconnection.</p>

<p>Start by writing down your assumptions about the scenario. How has it made you feel and what assumptions have you automatically made about why they are acting this way? This will help you mentalise yourself and bring awareness to the nature of your own feelings and reactions.</p>

<p>Now, bringing an empathetic and curious stance when considering the situation, consider the following questions?</p>

<p>Q. What might be causing them to act like this?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. What might be going on in their life that I am not aware of?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. What would cause somebody to behave in this way?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. What else might this person be thinking and feeling that I have not considered?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Make some notes about the differences in how you felt when doing the two reflections.</p>

<p>Did you notice a difference in your sense of the situation and your feelings towards the other person when you mentalised them?</p>

<p>Were you able to find a new or alternative perspective by bringing a mentalising stance to the second exercise?</p>

<p>** Exercise Part 2 **</p>

<p>Consider other times in your life when you noticed that you were not really mentalising but mind reading. Think about what was happening in the situation.</p>

<p>Q. Can you remember feeling a particular way when you were mindreading?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. What might you have projected onto them that was not actually connected with their experience but more to do with your own feelings and thoughts?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. How might the situation have been different if you had brought a mentalising stance to the situation and communicated your uncertainty to the other person?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Remember, our mentalising capacity turns off when we are feeling stressed, anxious or experiencing difficult emotions, so don’t worry - it’s normal for this to happen. The important thing is to bring awareness to this process so that we can change our responses and reactions to misunderstandings that happen as a result of mindreading.</p>

<p>The more we are able to practice mentalizing, the more we will experience empathy and a sense of connection in our relationships.  Our ability to mentalise is connected with our ability to connect with and become attuned to the experience of other people, while at the same time recognising that each person has their own unique way of experiencing something.</p>
