  <li>Be attentive. Be interested. Be alert and not distracted. Create a positive atmosphere through nonverbal behaviour.</li>
  <li>Be a sounding board – allow the speaker to bounce ideas and feelings off you while assuming a nonjudgmental, non-critical manner.</li>
  <li>Don’t ask a lot of questions. They can give the impression you are “grilling” the speaker.</li>
  <li>Act like a mirror – reflect back what you think the speaker is saying and feeling.</li>
  <li>Don’t discount the speaker’s feelings by using stock phrases like “It’s not that bad,” or “You’ll feel better tomorrow.”</li>
  <li>Don’t let the speaker “hook” you. This can happen if you get angry or upset, allow yourself to get involved in an argument, or pass judgment on the other person.</li>
  <li>Indicate you are listening by:
• Providing brief, acknowledging responses, e.g., “Uh-huh,” “I see.”
• Giving nonverbal acknowledgements, e.g., head nodding, facial expressions matching the speaker, open and relaxed body expression, eye contact.
• Invitations to say more, e.g., “Tell me about it,” “I’d like to hear about that.”</li>
  <li>Follow good listening “ground rules:”
• Don’t interrupt.
• Don’t change the subject or move in a new direction.
• Don’t rehearse in your own head.
• Don’t interrogate.
• Don’t teach.
• Don’t give advice.
• <strong>Do</strong> reflect back to the speaker what you understand and how you think the speaker feels.</li>
