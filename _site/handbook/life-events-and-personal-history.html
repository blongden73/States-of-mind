<p>There is no need to share your work with others but it can be very beneficial to express the insights you gain from the exercise with somebody you trust and feel comfortable with.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will need a pen and paper. You can coloured pens and other drawing materials if you have access to them and would like to develop your work creatively,</p>

<p>**Step 3: ** When you are ready, settle yourself into a comfortable position and take as many slow, deep breaths as you need to feel relaxed and focused on the present moment. It can be helpful to affirm to yourself that this activity is for your personal development and any distractions can wait until you have taken this time for yourself.</p>

<p>Notice what memories and associations naturally emerge as you begin to reflect. Your mind will naturally connect with certain images, memories, feelings and associations. If you have many memories come to mind, you may like to make a list of them so that you can come back to them later. If you can only think of a few, there’s no pressure, some may come later, as you progress with the activity and if they don’t it’s ok just to focus on a few.</p>
