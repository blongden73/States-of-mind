  <h2 class="slide-title">What is depression?</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Depression is an experience that manifests in our mental, emotional and physical experience .</p>

<p>It is characterised by an intense preoccupation with negative thinking about our past, current and future self. These ways of thinking are accompanied by an emotional experience of meaninglessness and ‘apathy’, which is the loss of interest or pleasure in life.</p>

<p>People experiencing depression also experience changes to their physical state, such as increased tiredness and fatigue.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>For a long time, psychiatrists believed that depression was caused by a lack of serotonin and dopamine in the brain as these are brain chemicals that are related to our mood and sense of motivation and enjoyment in life.</p>

<p>So far, no research has been able to identify a causal relationship between neurochemistry and depression. Some people who have high levels of serotonin can experience chronic depression, as well as people with low levels. </p>

<p>The difficulty with identifying a single biological cause for depression is that there are many factors that contribute to our neurochemistry, such as the amount of exercise we do, the food we eat and the types of social environments that we live in.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Social exclusion and rejection can cause experiences of physical numbness and a lack of emotion.</p>

<p>Researchers who studied people who had been excluded from a society or group found that it was common for them to shut down their emotional response rather than experiencing heightened states of distress.</p>

<p>“It was as though they had been hit with a stun gun”</p>

<p>They suggest could be an adaptive response to prevent retaliation against the group and to keep painful emotions out of awareness.</p>

<p>He explored how people respond to distressing experiences by focusing narrowly on the present moment in an attempt to avoid the painful emotions caused by recent failure, which shuts off the mind to states of self awareness and problem solving capacities.</p>

<p>“Time seems to drag, and the person remains stuck in a relatively empty present moment, cut off from past and future. Deprived of reasons for action, the person may become passive, lethargic, and idle.”</p>

<p>Mindfulness allows us to take a new perspective on our experience, that is characterised by openness, curiosity and acceptance of our experience. This allows us to strengthen brain networks that enable us to view our thoughts as mental events rather than permanent and factual aspects of our experience.</p>

<p>Recent small trials Recent research has found that young people who took part in mindfulness programmes experience a range of beneficial outcomes including reduced depression, improved coping skills, improved mood, and improved post-traumatic stress symptoms.</p>

<p>A review of nine clinical trials analyzing people with severe depression found MBCT reduced a patient’s chances of relapsing for up to 60 weeks, regardless of their sex, age, education or relationship status. The analysis compared MBCT with routine treatments for depression, including antidepressants. </p>

‘ I want to go to a life drawing class this week.’</strong></p>

<p>Ask others to help you. By asking for the support of your friends it will help reinforce your goals and will also mean that you can share the experience with somebody else. Ask if they can help you build it into your routine.</p>

<p>Recording your progress will provide more of a sense of control. Once every few weeks reflect on how things have changes and what difference these changes, no matter how small, have made on your mood.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Finding a balance </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Ultimately, our mood is influenced by many aspects of our lives. It is natural and normal to feel uncomfortable emotions and to be triggered by difficult events in our lives.</p>

<p>Sometimes we may spend longer periods of time feeling low and powerless over how we experience life.</p>

<p>Overcoming depression involves developing an understanding of the areas of our lives that are not serving us, or that are out of balance, so that we can support ourselves to find new ways of experiencing self care, meaning and purpose in our lives.</p>
