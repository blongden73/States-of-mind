  <div class="slide-description"><ul>
  <li>
    <p>Researchers have described a stage of the stress response called ‘Fright’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a state of intense distress that is triggered when intense fear combines with a sense of being trapped or constrained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If somebody is not able to release energy by escaping or defending themselves from a situation that is highly distressing, the body begins to shut down and our mind and body become ‘immobile’.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tonic immobility (fright) is almost always displayed when the person is overwhelmed by threat and not allowed and not able to act aggressively ( defend themselves) against the threat.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Social exclusion and rejection can cause experiences of physical numbness and a lack of emotion.</p>

<p>Researchers who studied people who had been excluded from a society or group found that it was common for them to shut down their emotional response rather than experiencing heightened states of distress.</p>

<p>“It was as though they had been hit with a stun gun”</p>

<p>They suggest could be an adaptive response to prevent retaliation against the group and to keep painful emotions out of awareness.</p>

<p>He explored how people respond to distressing experiences by focusing narrowly on the present moment in an attempt to avoid the painful emotions caused by recent failure, which shuts off the mind to states of self awareness and problem solving capacities.</p>

<p>“Time seems to drag, and the person remains stuck in a relatively empty present moment, cut off from past and future. Deprived of reasons for action, the person may become passive, lethargic, and idle.”</p>

<p>Mindfulness allows us to take a new perspective on our experience, one that is characterised by openness, curiosity and acceptance. This allows us to strengthen brain networks that enable us to view our thoughts as mental events rather than permanent and factual aspects of our experience.</p>

<p>Recent research has found that young people who took part in mindfulness programmes experience a range of beneficial outcomes including reduced depression, improved coping skills, improved mood, and improved post-traumatic stress symptoms.</p>

<p>A review of nine clinical trials analyzing people with severe depression found MBCT reduced a patient’s chances of relapsing for up to 60 weeks, regardless of their sex, age, education or relationship status.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance and understanding **

  <h2 class="slide-title">What is Unconditional Positive Regard?</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Unconditional Positive Regard is a term coined by Carl Rogers, who developed person centred-therapy a method where the person seeking therapy was seen as central to the direction of the therapeutic work and held as the expert of their own experience. Rogers used the term to describe the complete and loving acceptance of another person.</p>

<p>‘ True empathy is always free of any evaluative or diagnostic quality’</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Why is unconditional  positive regard beneficial for depression? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>People who are experiencing depression often hold an underlying belief that they are not loveable, are flawed and not worthy of love &amp; acceptance.  </p>

<p>Why is unconditional positive regard important when people are experiencing depression? </p>

<p>By showing unconditional positive regard it allows others to open up about negative beliefs and parts of themselves they feel ashamed of. </p>

<p>Unconditional positive regard removes any judgement or evaluation of others and allows others to feel that they are able to be accepted for who they are, without needing to change.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Behavioural activation </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>The idea behind behavioural activation is to gradually change small aspects of how we live, so that we can slowly change our experience of ourselves in our everyday lives and explore what changes positively affect your mood and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Behaviour Activation works by increasing the amount of rewarding activities in your life. By changing habits and behaviours it creates new pathways in the brain that reinforce behaviour change.</p>

<p>Past research has proven  that BA is effective for treating depression. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Tips for behavioural activation </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Don’t chose what you think you should do, chose something that you personally enjoy and want to do. Imagine a positive life that you want to have, what sorts of activities and things are you doing?</p>

<p>The aim is to allow yourself to feel joy, contentment and other positive and reassuring feelings through the activities in your everyday life.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Start small and make it measurable</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Chose something small. This could be anything from</p>

<p><strong>‘ I want to make my bed every morning’ to<br />
‘ I want to go to a life drawing class this week.’</strong></p>

<p>Ask others to help you. By asking for the support of your friends it will help reinforce your goals and will also mean that you can share the experience with somebody else. Ask if they can help you build it into your routine.</p>

<p>Recording your progress will provide more of a sense of control. Once every few weeks reflect on how things have changes and what difference these changes, no matter how small, have made on your mood.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Finding a balance </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Ultimately, our mood is influenced by many aspects of our lives. It is natural and normal to feel uncomfortable emotions and to be triggered by difficult events in our lives.</p>

<p>Sometimes we may spend longer periods of time feeling low and powerless over how we experience life.</p>

<p>Overcoming depression involves developing an understanding of the areas of our lives that are not serving us, or that are out of balance, so that we can support ourselves to find new ways of experiencing self care, meaning and purpose in our lives.</p>
