  <div class="slide-description"><p>Our behaviour in relationships is driven by our evolutionary needs for safety, love and connection with others.</p>

<p>Everyone has these needs for love, connection and a sense of belonging and these core needs are what drive our behaviour in relationships and how we interact with others.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Attunement in Relationships </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Our relationship with our family provides us with our first experiences of what relationships are like.</p>

<p>The way that our parent/s responded to our needs for authenticity and connection in childhood shapes our understanding of whether we can trust others to meet these needs .</p>

<p>If our family was present and attuned to what we needed and reflected back to us a positive sense of self, we will carry a sense of self worth and self-esteem into our adult relationships and will feel able to communicate openly and honesty about our emotional life.</p>

<p>This process of reflecting back our authentic self is called ‘attunement’.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">What influences our personal relationships? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Our early relationship with our parents are one of the biggest influences on how we view relationships and interact with others in our later life.</p>

<p>It is common to internalise beliefs that we developed in our early childhood relationships, such as positive beliefs of being able to depend on others for support or limiting beliefs such as feeling as if we need to abandon our needs to remain in a positive relationship with others.</p>

<p>By understanding the different relationship styles and dynamics that we can develop we can become aware of how and why we struggle in relationships and learn how to change any behaviours that hold us back.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The ‘good enough parent’</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>A Psychologist called Donald Winnicott coined this term to refer to the fact that no parent can meet our needs all of the time and that no parenting style can be completely perfect.</p>

<p>Our parents are individuals with their own potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from their childhoods.</p>

<p>If our parents punished us or were unavailable when we needed them emotionally, we may come to develop a belief that it is unsafe or uncomfortable expressing our needs with others as adults. This ‘non-attunement’ can have a significant impact on our sense of self worth, our ability to regulate our emotions and our mental health.</p>

<p>Although no parent can meet all of our needs all of the time, the amount of attunement that they were able to provide has been shown to influence the quality of our relationships as an adult.</p>

<p>We may become enmeshed in the emotional life of our partner, friends or family, instead of prioritising our own emotional needs and feeling confident in our ability to express these in our relationships.</p>

<p>This can lead to a feeling in our relationships, that we are undeserving of love and attention and that our partner’s needs are more important than ours.</p>

<p>People who have experienced this type of relationship pattern may find themselves in relationships where they feel misunderstood and resentful.

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Neuroscientists have discovered that the brain is able to continue reshaping itself through our adolescence and adult life. This means that early emotional and behavioural patterns can change with new experiences that we have throughout our lives.</p>

<p>Often, we will repeat similar patterns in our relationships due to the way our early childhood experiences shape our perception of the present day, yet our relationships in adult life can also reshape our perception of what relationships can be like.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Melanie Klein was a psychologist who focuses on the relationships between parents and children.</p>

<p>She coined the term ‘splitting’ to describe a psychological defence that young children develop to manage ambivalent feelings towards their parents.</p>

<p>As young children we manage difficult feelings in relationships by engaging in a process called ‘splitting’. This process splits our perception of our parents into either a ‘good parent’ or a ‘bad parent’.</p>

<p>This process causes feelings of either idealisation in relationships or feelings of resentment and an inability to see the other persons good qualities.</p>

<p>Healthy relationships require that we are aware of this tendency and are able to love another person while experiencing both their positive and more difficult behaviours.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Empathic listening is a type of listening that involves tuning into the emotional message that a person is communicating. 
Empathic listening helps people to understand their emotions better, builds trust and helps both the speaker and listener to develop emotional intelligence.</p>

<p>Bifocal vision is a way to provide feedback about another person’s non-verbal communication and listen to the deeper message they are communicating.</p>

<p>For example, if somebody is telling us that they have had a good week but their tone of voice is low, bifocal vision allows us to pick up on this mis-match between what the person is saying and the emotional message they are giving to us. 
By feeding back both the verbal message and the emotional message that we are hearing from the speaker, we allow them to feel seen and understood on a deeper level.</p>

<p><strong>Wounding in relationships.</strong>Wounding occurs in relationships when there has been conflict or emotional neglect that has been left unresolved in the relationship. The emotional impact of the wounding causes the person to behave in ways that protect them from further harm. </p>

<p><strong>Some examples of patterns of behaviour that emerge from wounding in relationships are:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoiding contact with the person who has caused the wounding and withdrawing attention and communication. </li>
  <li>Acting out and harming the other person out of fear and desperation. This could take the form of abusive text messages, manipulation and blackmail or physical and verbal abuse. </li>
  <li>Becoming hypervigilant to the actions of the other person and other relationships. Hypervigilance is caused by an overactive nervous response to emotional harm and wounding. Hypervigilance may look like stalking, constantly checking your phone to see if the other person has messaged you or become preoccupied with thoughts about the other person and ruminating about the issue , without seeking to resolve it or repair the issue in their presence.  </li>

This way of being with each other is what the Psychologist Bowlby called a secure base. How can you provide and recognise a secure base in relationships? </p>

<p>Problems are addressed as they arise in relationships, without the person harbouring resentment or communicating in unclear ways about the nature of the problem. </p>

<p>When the person is upset and emotionally struggling, the partner makes space to understand and listen to them, without minimising or punishing you for experiencing the emotions.  </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities for growth, not personal attacks or opportunities to play a blame game. People who are secure in their relationships, do not take criticism as a reason to blame the other, but are open to listening to the issue and adapting their behaviour to better meet the needs of their partner. </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities to create growth and understanding in the relationship. By learning about what is causing the problems, the partner is better able to understand the needs of the other person and what they need to feel safe and secure, instead of misunderstood and anxious.  </p>

<p>By setting boundaries we can improve our self esteem and prevent difficult feelings of resentment, anger and stress from emerging in our relationships.
Healthy boundaries are flexible and an essential part of healthy relationships where each person respects the boundaries of the other.</p>

<p>When healthy boundaries are present, each person understands that they are responsible for advocating for their own needs in relationships and communicating clearly so that they can get their needs met.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">How to set boundaries </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Recognise that you have a right to set boundaries about things you do and do not want. Healthy people will respect your need to set boundaries.</p>

<p>Practice communicating the boundary to other friends or family before setting the boundary with the person you need to set the boundary with. Communicate the boundary calmly, firmly, clearly and respectfully. 
Do not justify or apologise for the boundary you are setting.</p>

<p>Remember that you are not responsible for the feelings for the person you are setting the boundary with, your only responsibly is to assert the boundary in a respectful way.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Why is it difficult to leave unhealthy relationships?  </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Even if we know our relationships are unfitlfilling and not meeting our needs, it can feel  difficult to move forward and take the initiative to end the relationship. The feelings of pain and detachment are extremely strong feelings that motivate us to maintain the relationship at all costs. It is actually painful emotions that can keep us in unhealthy relationships, not just the positive ones.</p>

<p>Once our painful feelings of abandonment and low self esteem are activated, we become focused on reconnecting with the person and often trick ourselves into believing that each time we reconnect, we will get our needs met the next time, causing repeating cycles of rupture, repair and further rupture when we realise that the problems still exist but we feel powerless to change them.</p>

<p>This causes us to feel even more hopeless and even less able to solve problems in our relationships and get our needs met. This belief can cause us to develop the belief that no relationship will meet our needs because we internalise the experience and blame ourselves for the feelings of isolation and neglect.</p>

<p>The fear of being alone and unloved causes us to maintain relationships that are only partially able to meet our needs and we end up feeling unfulfilled and distressed. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Ending relationships. </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Relationships come to an end for many reasons. They may end out of personal choice or for reasons outside of our control. Ending relationships can be difficult if we feel a sense of loyalty for the other person or if we have been avoiding ending the relationship out of fear of the consequences.<br />
Consciously ending a relationship in a healthy way is a skill that we can develop which can have benefits for our emotional wellbeing.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recognise that if a relationship is not feeling right for you, it will not be an appropriate relationship for the other person either.</li>
  <li>Recognise that ending a relationship will bring up emotions for both people involved in the ending and creating space for both people’s experiences to be heard and respected is crucial for both people to feel acknowledged in the ending. 
3.Be emotionally honest about the reasons for wanting to end the relationship. Being emotionally honest does not involve blaming or criticising the other person but describing your personal feelings using ‘I’ statements not ‘You’ statements.</li>
  <li>Do not send mixed messages but be clear about your reasons for wanting to end the relationship.</li>
</ol>
