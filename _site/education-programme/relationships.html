Need for connection - we all have a need to feel like we are seen, understood and valued in our relationships.
This module explores how by developing our authenticity we can enjoy more fulfilling and connected relationships with others. 
You will learn how these two needs are interrelated and how by understanding how to recognise and express your needs in relationships you can experience more fulfilling and close connections with others.</p>

            <p>Title: What influences our personal relationships? </p>
            <p>Description: Our relationships with others are in many ways a reflection of our relationship with ourselves. 
Our emotional relationship with ourselves is also shaped by early childhood experiences and how we were related to by others when we were young. 
Our early relationship with our parents can shape our view of relationships and behaviour with others in our later life. We may internalise beliefs that we developed in our early childhood relationships, such as not being loveable, not being enough as we are or that we need to abandon our needs to remain in a positive relationship with others. 
Our parents are also individuals with their own potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from their childhoods. The beliefs and mindsets about relationships that we develop in our childhood can shape our worldview about how relationships are. 
As human beings, we all have the capacity to relearn how to relate in ways that allow us to feel connected, understood and seen for who we most essentially are. 
 By understanding the different relationship styles and dynamics we can develop an awareness of how and why we struggle in relationships and how we can change our unhelpful patterns. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Relationships with self </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>‘Fear of compassion for self and compassion from others were also significantly linked to fear of compassion for others.’ 
(Gilbert et al, 2010.)</p>

<p>Paul Gilbert is an evolutionary psychologist who explored the link between self compassion and the quality of our relationships. Gilbert found that people who struggled to feel care and compassion for themselves found it more difficult to relate with compassion for others.</p>

<p>Gilberts work highlights how our relationship with ourselves has a real and lasting influence on our ability to form close and caring relationships with the people in our lives.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Family Relationships </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Our relationship with our family provides us with our first experiences of what relationships are like. The way that our parent/s responded to our needs for authenticity and connection in childhood shapes our understanding of whether we can trust others to meet these needs .<br />
If our family was present and attuned to what we needed and reflected back to us a positive sense of self, we will carry a sense of self worth and self-esteem into our adult relationships and will feel able to communicate openly and honesty about our emotional life. 
This process of reflecting back our authentic self is called ‘attunement’. 
If our parents punished us or were unavailable when we needed them emotionally, we may come to develop a belief that it is unsafe or uncomfortable expressing our needs with others as adults. This ‘non-attunement’ can have a significant impact on our sense of self worth, our ability to regulate our emotions and our mental health. 
Although no parent can meet all of our needs all of the time, the amount of attunement that they were able to provide has a direct impact on our mental health as an adult.</p>

Healthy relationships require that both people are able to present and attuned to the needs of the other and are able to notice how their own emotions impact on the experience of the other person.</p>

<p>When there is conflict in healthy relationships, both people are able to repair the rupture by not blaming, withdrawing or attacking the other person but instead seek to identify what has caused the rupture and work collaboratively to find a solution to the underlying issue.</p>

<p>When conflict arises in healthy relationships, both people can resolve misunderstandings, develop a deeper understanding of the needs of their partner and provide support for the other person, without neglecting their own needs and emotional honesty.  </p>

<p>In healthy relationships, each person will feel that they can rely on the other for emotional support, while respecting each others boundaries and needs.</p>

<p>If, in our childhood world, we lived in an environment where we took on caretaking roles for the adults around us, or our siblings, we may come to develop a relationship pattern where we believe that putting the needs of others before our own is more important than communicating our own needs in relationships. If we have experienced this type of relational environment growing up, we are likely to become easily upset and anxious if the other person in the relationship withdraws emotionally or physically from us. The reason for this is because we have come to believe that our emotional wellbeing is reliant on the emotional wellbeing of another person. </p>

<p>We may become enmeshed in the emotional life of our partner, friends or family, instead of prioritizing our own emotional needs and feeling confident in our ability to express these in our relationships. This can lead to a feeling in our relationships, that we are undeserving of love and attention and that our partner’s needs are more important than ours.</p>

<p>People who have experienced this type of relationship pattern may find themselves in relationships where they feel misunderstood and resentful. They may idealise and put their partner on a pedestal or find themselves engaging in manipulative behaviour in an attempt to not lose their partners attention and care. </p>

<p>If we do not experience relationships that were attuned to our needs as children, we can lose trust in other people’s ability to understand our inner world and come to feel that we must manage our problems alone, without the presence of another.</p>

<p>People with avoidant attachment styles protect themselves against childhood wounding and painful experiences by developing the belief that it is safer to manage feelings alone rather than trust another person to be able to provide them with the soothing and care taking behaviour that they require.</p>

<p>People with avoidant relationships styles may struggle with intimacy in relationships, as they may struggle to feel able to be vulnerable and honest about their emotional world in the presence of another person.</p>

<p>People with avoidant relationship patterns often act as if they do not need others when they are feeling vulnerable and become closed off when they experience difficulties in relationships.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Neuroplasticity and emotional development. </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Neuroscientists have discovered that the brain is able to continue reshaping itself through our adolescence and adult life. This means that early emotional and behavioural patterns can change with new experiences that we have throughout our lives. 
Often, we will repeat similar patterns in our relationships due to the way our early childhood experiences shape our perception of the present day, yet our relationships in adult life can also reshape our perception of what relationships can be like. 
The brains ability to reshape itself has significant positive implications for our understanding of how people can heal difficult relationship patterns, learning new skills and develop new beliefs about their ability to experience intimacy and connection with others.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">How relationship styles  affects our experiences in relationships </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Research shows that people are likely to be drawn to people who share the same relationships style as their caregivers.<br />
For example, if our parents were distant or unavailable when we were younger, we may be attracted to people who are avoidant of intimacy and closeness into our adult life as this is the relationship style that we have become familiar with. 
If somebody with an anxious pattern has a relationship with somebody with an avoidant partner, it may cause a ‘push and pull’ dynamic in relationships.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Developing compassion for ourselves </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>If our relationship pattern is causing us to experience unfulfilling relationships or we are struggling to experience closeness in our relationships, self-compassion is an important tool for caring for ourselves and supporting our mental health. Without self-compassion we can reinforce limiting beliefs that we are unlovable and incapable of experiencing intimacy and closeness in relationships.</p>

<p>When we experience conflict or challenges in our relationships it causes our nervous systems to react, due to an evolutionary fear of rejection, abandonment and isolation.</p>

<p>By practicing self compassion we can provide ourselves with the need for reassurance and a sense of safety in the absence of another person.</p>

  <li>Notice the critical inner narrative</li>
  <li>Notice the tension in your body created by these critical thoughts and beliefs</li>
  <li>Bring awareness to the areas of tension without resisting them</li>

When we do not judge or criticise the behaviour of another person but take time to understand and work through problems together, we show ourselves and the other that we do not see problems in thee relationship as Indications of their worth but as an opportunity for growth and deeper levels of understanding and connection in our relationships. 
By respecting another person as having the same needs for love, connection and understanding as ourselves, we can overcome the judgement and limiting beliefs about others that can cause distance and misunderstanding in relationships.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">I -it and I-Thou relationships </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Martin Buber Martin Buber was a prominent twentieth century philosopher, religious thinker, political activist and educator. 
He explored different ways that people perceived and acted towards other people in their relationships. He called these different ways of viewing others in relationship as ‘I-Thou’ and ‘I-it’ relationships. 
In an I-Thou relationship, the other person is seen for who they really are, not for what they represent or signify. In this relationships, there is a willingness to understand the other person on a deeper level than our immediate judgements, assumptions and stereotypes that we bring to the relationship. 
In an I-It relationship, we view the other person more as a ‘thing’ than a human being with a story and individual needs. In and I-it relationship we assume we know the other person, without needing to take time to develop a close and mutual relationship with them.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Splitting</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Melanie Klein was a psychologist who focuses on the relationships between parents and children. She coined the term ‘splitting’ to describe a psychological defence that young children develop to manage ambivalent feelings towards their parents. 
As young children we manage difficult feelings in relationships by engaging in a process called ‘splitting’. 
This process ‘splits’ our perception of our parents into either a ‘good parent’ or a ‘bad parent’. 
This process causes feelings of either idealisation in relationships or feelings of resentment and an inability to see the other persons good qualities. 
Healthy relationships require that we are able to tolerate ambivalence in relationships and are able to love another person while experiencing both their positive and difficult behaviours.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Mentalising is a skill that we all use in our everyday lives.
The term is used to describe our capacity to understand our own mental state and that of other people and how this affects our behaviour.
Mentalising allows us to think consciously about what we are thinking and feeling, aswell as being curious about what may be going on in other people’s minds.  </p>

<p>Mentalising allows us to switch from concrete thought ‘ She is behaving like that because’ to a wondering stance ‘ I wonder why she may be behaving like that’. </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>When we are distressed, distracted or experiencing conflict in our relationships, it affects our capacity to consider that another person’s experience is different to our own. 
Without open communication, we make guesses and assumptions about what is going on in other people’s minds. 
We assume that other people think in the way that we do 
We project our own feelings and past experiences onto other people 
We make quick decisions about the meaning of other people’s behaviour without taking time to check it out with them 
We do not take time to consider how other people have different experiences than our own

  <h2 class="slide-title">How does mentalising improve our relationships?</h2>
  <div class="slide-description">
<p>It helps us to reduce misunderstandings in our personal relationships as it allows us to clarify what people are really experiencing, instead of making assumptions. </p>

<p>It helps us to develop our ability to reflect on our motivations, beliefs, values and feelings in any given situation so that we can understand our reactions and responses to situations with more coherence. </p>

<p>It helps us to regulate our emotions and limiting beliefs, by allowing us to develop the ability to step back from our experience and notice what is causing it.  </p>

<p>When we mentalise other people, it makes them feel like we are really paying attention and attempting to understand exactly what is happening for them. This process of clarification is really useful for helping us to develop trust and understanding in relationships. </p>

<p>When we notice the connection between our feelings and actions it allows us to feel a sense of choice and control over how we react and respond to different situations. </p>

<p>What does research tell us about mentalising? </p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1.	People who are skilled at mentalising are considerably more resilient when faced with stressful situations and are able to self reflect and process experiences of adversity in their lives with more coherence and understanding.  
2.	They are more able to make sense of both the external world and their internal world of thoughts, feelings and emotions.  

3.	They have an increased ability for creative thought, the ability to hold multiple perspectives and are generally more capable of connecting with the inner lives of other people.

  <h2 class="slide-title">Listening skills</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Listening is one of the most powerful tools for improving communication in our relationships. 
When we listen well to others, we indicate that we care about them and their experiences.  Listening is a skill that can be developed and improved over time. 
How can we listen well? 
Pay attention: 
Show curiosity and interest
Show you are listening by using non verbal feedback
Mirror the other person’s body language, such as how they are sitting, to help the person feel you are connected with their experience. 
Reflect back to the speaker what you have heard them say. This allows the person to know that they have been heard. 
Ask clarifying questions. By clarifying with the other person what you have heard you show that you are motivated to really understand the message they are trying to communicate. This also helps the other person to clarify what they are trying to communicate. 
Invite the person to say more. By inviting the person to speak more, you help them feel that you are interested in understanding what they have to say. 
Do not interrupt the speaker by sharing your experiences opinions or beliefs in response to what you have heard. When we interrupt the process of listening we send the other person the message that we are not focused on their experience but are more concerned with sharing our own.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Barriers to good listening </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Being distracted by setting: If our attention is divided, our ability to listen well will be affected. To remove this barrier, make sure you are in a setting where you will not be interrupted and remove your phone or other distractions within he room. 
Being distracted by our thoughts: When we listen, it is very natural to become distracted and preoccupied by our own personal narrative and reactions to what we are hearing. By becoming aware of becoming lost in our own thoughts we can return to good listening. 
Becoming distracted by emotions. If the conversation creates an emotional response in us,, it can prevent us from being fully present to the speaker. Good listening involves maintaining curiosity and feeding back our emotional response to the speaker. By feeding back how we are feeling, it shows that we are empathising with what we are hearing. 
Becoming nervous about silence.  Silence in conversation can make us feel uncomfortable and awkward . By interrupting to prevent silences we spend a message to the other person that we are not able to contain the feelings of discomfort in the listening process. By taking time to allow silence, or by using silence to summarise back to the listener what you have heard, you can help the listener to feel supported and better understood. 
Problem solving and giving advice: By trying to solve the other person’s problem we can make the other person feel that we are trying to change or fix them, which will often reduce a person’s desire to share their experience.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Empathic Listening and Bifocal vision </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Empathic listening is a type of listening that involves tuning into the emotional message that a person is communicating. 
Empathic listening helps people to understand their emotions better, builds trust and helps both the speaker and listener to develop emotional intelligence.<br />
Bifocal vision is a way to provide feedback about another person’s non-verbal communication and listen to the deeper message they are communicating. 
For example, if somebody is telling us that they have had a good week but their tone of voice is low, bifocal vision allows us to pick up on this mis-match between what the person is saying and the emotional message they are giving to us. 
By feeding back both the verbal message and the emotional message that we are hearing from the speaker, we allow them to feel seen and understood on a deeper level.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Conflict , rupture and repair  </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>What happens in the brain when we experience ruptures in our relationships? </p>

<p>Research has shown that when we experience conflict and rupture in our relationships, the same areas of our brain light up as those that are activated when we break a leg or experience physical pain. </p>

<p>Wounding in relationships </p>

<p>Wounding occurs in relationships when there has been conflict or emotional neglect that has been left unresolved in the relationship. The emotional impact of the wounding causes the person to behave in ways that protect them from further harm. </p>

<p>Some examples of patterns of behaviour that emerge from wounding in relationships are:</p>

<p>Avoiding contact with the person who has caused the wounding and withdrawing attention and communication. </p>

<p>Acting out and harming the other person out of fear and desperation. This could take the form of abusive text messages, manipulation and blackmail or physical and verbal abuse. </p>

<p>Becoming hypervigilant to the actions of the other person and other relationships. Hypervigilance is caused by an overactive nervous response to emotional harm and wounding. Hypervigilance may look like stalking, constantly checking your phone to see if the other person has messaged you or become preoccupied with thoughts about the other person and ruminating about the issue , without seeking to resolve it or repair the issue in their presence.  </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Creating a safe space for resolving conflict </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>In healthy relationships, each person feels seen and understood for their true nature and is able to act and communicate from this place. This way of being with each other is what the Psychologist Bowlby called a secure base. How can you provide and recognise a secure base in relationships? </p>

<p>Problems are addressed as they arise in relationships, without the person harbouring resentment or communicating in unclear ways about the nature of the problem. </p>

<p>When the person is upset and emotionally struggling, the partner makes space to understand and listen to them, without minimising or punishing you for experiencing the emotions.  </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities for growth, not personal attacks or opportunities to play a blame game. People who are secure in their relationships, do not take criticism as a reason to blame the other, but are open to listening to the issue and adapting their behaviour to better meet the needs of their partner. </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities to create growth and understanding in the relationship. By learning about what is causing the problems, the partner is better able to understand the needs of the other person and what they need to feel safe and secure, instead of misunderstood and anxious.  </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Setting boundaries is a tool that is important in all of our relationships. 
If we did not learn to set boundaries in childhood, it is important to do so in adulthood, so that we can clearly express our feelings and needs. Setting healthy boundaries helps us to communicate what types of behaviour we will/ will not tolerate from others by stating what is and is not acceptable to you. 
By setting boundaries we can improve our self esteem and prevent difficult feelings of resentment, anger and stress from emerging in our relationships.
Healthy boundaries are flexible and an essential part of healthy relationships where each person respects the boundaries of the other. 
When healthy boundaries are present, each person understands that they are responsible for advocating for their own needs in relationships and communicating clearly so that they can get their needs met.</p>

  <div class="slide-description">
<p>Even if we know our relationships are unfitlfilling and not meeting our needs, it can feel  difficult to move forward and take the initiative to end the relationship. The feelings of pain and detachment are extremely strong feelings that motivate us to maintain the relationship at all costs. It is actually painful emotions that can keep us in unhealthy relationships, not just the positive ones.</p>

<p>Once our painful feelings of abandonment and low self esteem are activated, we become focused on reconnecting with the person and often trick ourselves into believing that each time we reconnect, we will get our needs met the next time, causing repeating cycles of rupture, repair and further rupture when we realise that the problems still exist but we feel powerless to change them.</p>

<p>This causes us to feel even more hopeless and even less able to solve problems in our relationships and get our needs met. This belief can cause us to develop the belief that no relationship will meet our needs because we internalise the experience and blame ourselves for the feelings of isolation and neglect.</p>

<p>The fear of being alone and unloved causes us to maintain relationships that are only partially able to meet our needs and we end up feeling unfulfilled and distressed. </p>

Ending relationships can be difficult if we feel a sense of loyalty for the other person or if we have been avoiding ending the relationship out of fear of the consequences.<br />
Consciously ending a relationship in a healthy way is a skill that we can develop which can have benefits for our emotional wellbeing.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recognise that if a relationship is not feeling right for you, it will not be an appropriate relationship for the other person either.</li>
  <li>Recognise that ending a relationship will bring up emotions for both people involved in the ending and creating space for both people’s experiences to be heard and respected is crucial for both people to feel acknowledged in the ending. 
3.Be emotionally honest about the reasons for wanting to end the relationship. Being emotionally honest does not involve blaming or criticising the other person but describing your personal feelings using ‘I’ statements not ‘You’ statements.</li>
  <li>Do not send mixed messages but be clear about your reasons for wanting to end the relationship.</li>
