  <h2 class="slide-title">What shapes our relationships? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Your early relationship with your parents is one of the biggest influences on how you view relationships and interact with other people in your later life.</p>

<p>It is common to internalise beliefs that you developed in your early childhood relationships, such as positive beliefs of being able to depend on others for support or limiting beliefs such as feeling as if you need to abandon your needs to remain in positive relationships.</p>

<p>By understanding the different relationship styles and dynamics that you can develop you can become aware of how and why you struggle in relationships and learn how to change any behaviours that hold you back.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The ‘good enough parent’</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>A Psychologist called Donald Winnicott coined this term to refer to the fact that no parent can meet your needs all of the time and that no parenting style can be completely perfect.</p>

<p>Your parents are individuals with their own potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from their childhoods.</p>

<p>Although no parent can meet all of your needs all of the time, the amount of attunement that they were able to provide has been shown to influence the quality of your relationships as an adult.</p>

<p>If your parents punished you or were unavailable when you needed them emotionally, you may come to develop a belief that it is unsafe or uncomfortable expressing your needs with others as an adult.</p>

<p>You may become enmeshed in the emotional life of our partner, friends or family, instead of prioritising your own emotional needs and feeling confident in your ability to express these in your relationships.</p>

<p>This can lead you feeling that you are undeserving of love and attention and that other people’s needs are more important than your own.</p>

<p>If you have this type of relationship pattern you may find yourself in relationships where you feel misunderstood and resentful. You may idealise and put your partner on a pedestal or find yourself engaging in manipulative behaviour in an attempt to not lose your partners attention and care.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Splitting</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Melanie Klein was a psychologist who focuses on the relationships between parents and children.</p>

<p>She coined the term ‘splitting’ to describe a psychological defence that young children develop to manage ambivalent feelings towards their parents.</p>

<p>As a young child you manage difficult feelings in relationships by engaging in a process called ‘splitting’. This process splits your perception of your parents into either a ‘good parent’ or a ‘bad parent’.</p>

<p>This process causes feelings of either idealisation in relationships or feelings of resentment and an inability to see the other persons good qualities.</p>

<p>Healthy relationships require that you are aware of this tendency and are able to love another person while experiencing both their positive and more difficult behaviours.</p>

By interrupting to prevent silences you spend a message to the other person that you are not able to contain the feelings of discomfort in the listening process. By taking time to allow silence, or by using silence to summarise back to the listener what you have heard, you can help the listener to feel supported and better understood.</p>

<h1 id="problem-solving-and-giving-advice">Problem solving and giving advice:</h1>

<p>By trying to solve the other person’s problem you can make the other person feel that you are trying to change or fix them, which will often reduce a person’s desire to share their experience.</p>

<p>This type of listening helps people to understand their emotions better, builds trust and helps both the speaker and listener to develop their emotional intelligence.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Conflict, rupture and repair  </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p><strong>Wounding in relationships.</strong></p>

<p>Wounding occurs in relationships when there has been conflict or emotional neglect that has been left unresolved in the relationship. The emotional impact of the wounding causes the person to behave in ways that protect them from further harm. </p>

<p><strong>What happens in the brain when we experience ruptures in our relationships?</strong></p>

<p>Research has shown that when you experience conflict and rupture in our relationships, the same areas of your brain light up as those that are activated when you break a leg or experience physical pain. </p>

Hypervigilance may look like: 

Stalking, constantly checking your phone to see if the other person has messaged you or become preoccupied with thoughts about the other person and ruminating about the issue, without seeking to resolve it or repair the issue in their presence.  </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Creating a safe space for resolving conflict </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>In healthy relationships, each person feels seen and understood for their true nature and is able to act and communicate from this place.</p>

<p>Problems are addressed as they arise in relationships, without the person harbouring resentment or communicating in unclear ways about the nature of the problem. </p>

<p>When the person is upset and emotionally struggling, the partner makes space to understand and listen to them, without minimising or punishing you for experiencing the emotions.  </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities for growth, not personal attacks or opportunities to play a blame game. People who are secure in their relationships, do not take criticism as a reason to blame the other, but are open to listening to the feedback about how they make others feel.</p>

<p>If you did not learn to set boundaries in childhood, it is important to do so in adulthood, so that you can clearly express your feelings and needs. Setting healthy boundaries helps you to communicate what types of behaviour you will/ will not tolerate from others by stating what is and is not acceptable to you.</p>

<p>By setting boundaries you can improve your self esteem and prevent difficult feelings of resentment, anger and stress from emerging in your relationships.</p>

<p>When healthy boundaries are present, each person understands that they are responsible for advocating for their own needs in relationships and communicating clearly so that other people understand what they need.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Why is it difficult to leave unhealthy relationships?  </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Even if you know your relationships are unfitlfilling and not meeting our needs, it can feel  difficult to move forward and take the initiative to end the relationship.</p>

<p>The feelings of pain and detachment are extremely strong feelings that motivate you to maintain the relationship at all costs.</p>

<p>It is actually painful emotions that can keep you in unhealthy relationships, not just the positive ones.</p>

<p>Once our painful feelings of abandonment and low self esteem are activated, you become focused on reconnecting with the person and often trick ourselves into believing that each time you reconnect, you will get our needs met the next time, causing repeating cycles of rupture, repair and further rupture when you realise that the problems still exist but you feel powerless to change them.</p>

<p>This causes you to feel even more hopeless and even less able to solve problems in your relationships and get your needs met.</p>

<p>This belief can cause you to develop the perception that no relationship will meet your needs because you internalise the experience and blame yourself for the feelings of isolation and neglect.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Ending relationships. </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Relationships come to an end for many reasons. They may end out of personal choice or for reasons outside of our control.</p>

<p>Ending relationships can be difficult if you feel a sense of loyalty for the other person or if you have been avoiding ending the relationship out of fear of the consequences.</p>

<p>Consciously ending a relationship in a healthy way is a skill that you can develop which can have benefits for your emotional wellbeing.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><ol>
  <li>
    <p>Recognise that if a relationship is not feeling right for you, it will not be an appropriate relationship for the other person either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recognise that ending a relationship will bring up emotions for both people involved in the ending and creating space for both people’s experiences to be heard and respected is crucial for both people to feel acknowledged in the ending.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>3.Be emotionally honest about the reasons for wanting to end the relationship. Being emotionally honest does not involve blaming or criticising the other person but describing your personal feelings using ‘I’ statements not ‘You’ statements.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do not send mixed messages but be clear about your reasons for wanting to end the relationship.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support yourself by surrounding yourself with close and trusted friends who can help you express and process any difficult feelings you experience after ending an unhealthy relationship.</p>
  </li>
