<p>Feelings of resistance and the desire to procrastinate are inevitable feelings that will emerge as part of this work.</p>

<p>If you encounter these feelings, it is important that you begin to develop your ability to bring awareness, curiosity and an attitude of openness to them.</p>

<p>They are an important aspect of the work and if you encourage the exploration of these states, your work will deepen and your development will be enhanced.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Confidentiality </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Young people have told us that confidentiality is one of their top concerns when seeking answers to private or personal questions or problems. Perceived lack of confidentiality significantly deters young people from seeking support and advice from teachers, peers, parents or support agencies.</p>

<p>Upholding young people’s right to confidentiality, except when they are at risk of serious harm, is a crucial factor in supporting young people’s access to high quality confidential services that can promote wellbeing.</p>
