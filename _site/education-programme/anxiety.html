  <h2 class="slide-title">When anxiety becomes a problem</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Anxiety becomes a problem in our lives when we begin to notice a reduced ability to cope with situations in our everyday life.
If we have experienced a situation in the past that we have not processed, it can cause us to feel like we can’t manage or cope in the present, as our threat detector, or ‘smoke alarm’ becomes overactive and responds more sensitively to things we may not normally perceive as threatening.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The neuroscience of anxiety </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>The anxiety response begins in a part of the brain called the Amygdala. We share this part of the brain with all animals, as it is one of the most fundamental survival systems that allows us to detect threats in our environment.</p>

<p>Animal studies have shown that if you remove the amygdala, the animal loses any sense of fear or anxiety. 
 
The amygdala is activated in response to situations of fear and uncertainty. Once activated, this part of the brain sends a message through the vagus nerve to activate our parasympathetic nervous system. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title"></h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>The size of the amygdala has been shown to correlate with people’s sensitivity to aspects of the environment they consider as threatening or unsafe.</p>

<p>This is believed to be caused by past experiences of stress and fear that causes the brain to adapt to become more alert to future instances of threat so that we can recognise them more easily.</p>

<p>Research has shown that mindfulness and stress reduction programmes reduce the size of the amygalda and people’s levels of anxiety in situations previously experienced as threatening. The size of the amygdala is correlated with the degree to which people subjectively experience the world as safe or threatening.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The vagus nerve </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>The vagus nerve causes a response in the heart, lungs and gut, which is triggered by a release of adrenaline and cortisol, two hormones that are connected with the threat response.</p>

<p>This causes our heart to beat faster, our breathing to become more shallow and a sensation of ‘butterflys in the stomach’.</p>

<p>The higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol cause us to feel nervous and jittery as they are preparing us to escape the threat (Flight) or become defensive to  it ( Fight). The anxiety response is closely linked with the Freeze response, where we feel paralysed to act in the face of a threat.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The freeze response </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>When fighting or running seems impossible or because the threat seems too powerful, our brain triggers a ‘Freeze Response’ that can feel very difficult to break out of.</p>

<p>For example, if you have an upcoming test and you feel overwhelmed, you may feel paralysed and ‘frozen’ and unable to cope.</p>

<p>You may feel feelings of numbness, detachment and dissociation which is caused by your brain separating you from the unpleasantness and strength of your emotions.</p>

<p>You may also feel overwhelmed, a sense of stiffness or a feeling of holding your breath.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Rumination </h2>
  <div class="slide-description">
<p>When we imagine an aspect of a future situation that we feel we can’t cope with, our mind tries to solve the problem by thinking about it. This can cause a ‘Thought Loop’ that is caused by our thoughts triggering more feelings of stress and anxiety, that in turn fuel more thoughts and stronger emotions.</p>

<p>This process of overthinking in relation to a real or imagined future scenario that we perceive as threatening, is called ‘ Rumination’.</p>

<p>The word comes from the word ‘ruminate’ which is the continued chewing motion that animals use to digest their food. We can think of rumination as the process of ‘ chewing on our thoughts’. </p>

<p>Research has shown that people who ruminate more are more likely to struggle with anxiety and depression. This makes sense, as the more our minds focus on problems, the more we will feel stuck and unable to change them. </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>To break out of the stress response, we need to re-engage the body to remind the body that it is safe. When the body feels it is safe, it is able to process new information that can help us to see new possibilities.</p>

<p>This part of the module explores how we can activate the soothing system through exercise, breathing, mindfulness and social support.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Exercise</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>When we worry, our minds sends signals to our body that there is a still a potential threat that exists and the triggers our body to release the stress hormone cortisol, which makes us feel jittery and tense if not reduced. 
Exercise is beneficial for anxiety as it reduces levels of cortisol and increases our endorphins which improve our mood. 
Research has shown that 5 minutes of exercise can begin to reduce our levels of anxiety.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Breathing Exercises </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Breathing exercises are one of the best ways to reduce stress in the body. 
When we practice slow and deep breathing, it activates the vagus nerve which sends a signal to the brain that allows the body to relax.<br />
Breathing exercises help to quiet the mind and return our awareness to the present moment.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Mindfulness -Based Stress reduction</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>MBSR is a therapeutic tool that helps people to relax and return their attention to the present moment. 
As the anxiety is often accompanied by persistent worrying about the past and future, by bringing our awareness to the present moment, we can redirect our attention and focus to the here and now and relieve ourselves of distressing thought patterns.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Activating the Task Positive Network </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>The Default mode is switched OFF when we focus our attention on tasks or ‘doing things’. When we are in this mode, our ‘ Task Positive Network’ is activated. We can see this network as the ‘solution focused network.’ These networks are similar to a switch, when one is ON the other is OFF. 
 
This explains why we find it much more difficult to worry about a problem when we choose to go for a walk, when we go to meet our friends or when we are doing something that takes our attention away from the problem. If you experience a lot of worry, you can strengthen your Task Positive Network by adding particular tasks to your daily routine that ensure you spend less time in your mind ruminating about your fears and anxieties. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Acceptance and Self Compassion  </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>The anxiety response is kept going when we avoid our feelings through escaping to our mind ( rumination ).</p>

<p>Self compassion involves bringing awareness to our discomfort and distress and understanding that our pain and suffering is a normal part of being human.</p>

<p>By bringing an attitude of care and acceptance towards ourselves, we can focus our energy away from our worries and concerns, towards a dedicated attempt to reassure and support ourselves.</p>

<p>By turning towards our feelings, instead of resisting them, we can begin to self soothe and calm our anxiety.</p>

  <div class="slide-description">
<p>Diet a diet that stabilises your blood sugar. If your blood sugar is low, it triggers the stress response which makes you more likely to feel anxiety.</p>

<p>Speaking about it: 
Research shows that when we form connections with other people, we are reducing cortisol in the body. Our parasympathetic nervous system is turned off when we feel safe and supported. 
Sleep - at least 8 hours: 
Sleep is designed to reduce stress levels as it allows you to release the resistance that causes anxiety. Your fight or fight response is triggered when you do not get enough sleep.</p>
