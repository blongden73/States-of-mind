  <h2 class="slide-title">What is self awareness? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Self awareness is the ability to notice our thoughts, feelings and behaviour, as if we are an observer.
Self awareness allows us to understand ourselves and the impact we have on others. 
Self awareness is a tool that provides us with the power of choice, to redefine our narrative of how we experience ourselves. 
Through practicing self awareness, we can make new choices about how we live our lives and enhance our sense of wellbeing.</p>

<p><strong>The Johari Window is a visual representation of aspects of the self that are known or unknown to ourselves and others.</strong></p>

<p>The open area represents everything we know about ourselves. This is what people who know us know about us and what we are consciously aware of too.</p>

<p>The hidden area relates to all of the parts of ourselves that we do not share with others. This information that we keep private may relate to our fears and insecurities swell as your hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>The blind spot relates to our potential for personal growth through our close and trusted relationships. Our friends and family can provide us with feedback and honesty that can help us to see ourselves more clearly. This can relate to both our positive attributes and areas for growth.</p>

<p>The unknown relates to information about ourselves that is unconscious to both ourselves and others. This relates to parts of ourselves we still have yet to discover through new experiences.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p><strong>Self Awareness has been proven as a tool that can help us to flourish.</strong></p>

<p>The insight that self awareness provides allows us to feel more satisfied with our lives.</p>

<p>When cultivated fully, we no longer repress or hide our emotions or experiences and instead see them as ways to learn and grow.</p>

<p>Self awareness allows us to develop insight into our problems, behaviours and personal experiences.</p>

<p>This process of bringing conscious awareness to how we are living is the first step to having confidence that we can change our lives to be more positive and fulfilling. Without this insight and this belief in change, it is very difficult to know we can develop ourselves and we can become stuck feeling as if we have no control over how things are.</p>

  <div class="slide-description">
<p>We like to think of ourselves as one consistent personality or person but in reality, we are composed of many different aspects and parts, that all serve an important role in our lives. 
Self awareness allows us to recognise that our identity is not fixed but is an ever-changing reflection of our experiences, values and relationships. Self awareness allows us to explore the emotional connection or resistance we have to them.</p>

<p>By exploring the different aspects of our personal identity we can gain a deeper understanding of what makes us unique and what connects us most fundamentally with others.</p>

<p>We can then develop insights into the causes of our problems and our potential for growth, and recover our gifts and qualities that we are blind to.  </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Identity</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Our definition of identity isn’t fixed as we view it as a subjective and personal experience of how we chose to view ourselves.</p>

<p>Our identity relates to our self - image:  our perception of our value and our role in the world. Our identity changes and evolves as we develop, reflecting the dynamic inter-relationship between our life experience and our sense of self.</p>

<p>As our life history and identity are so closely related, exploring and bringing awareness to different aspects of our identity can provide an important foundation for self-discovery, self awareness and personal growth. </p>

<p>Exploring our identity can make us aware of past experiences that can bring up uncomfortable feelings and memories. While practicing these exercises, it’s important to remember that your identity is never fixed and that giving ourselves space and time to process and feel our reactions to parts of our identity is part of the healing process.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">How does identity relate to how we live?</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Everyday we have an experience of who we are. Sometimes this is a positive experience that affirms a clear and motivated sense of ourselves in the world, while at other times we can experience ourselves as struggling, unable to cope and helpless to our challenges.</p>

<p>Our mental health is reflected in our self image and so by developing the ability to reflect on ourselves we can develop more emotional and mental flexibility over how we experience our self image. This skill can be developed throughout life and is crucial for our mental health, relationships and general enjoyment of life. </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Carl Jung was a Swiss Psychologist who explored the personality and human nature. He was responsible for introducing concepts such as introversion and extroversion and the collective unconcious. 
Jung believed that ‘individuation’ was a process that was the main purpose of human development. This idea was that psychological health is achieved by seeking to live authentically ( to feel and act in accordance with who we most essentially are).  He believed that everybody had the ability and the impulse to move towards our fullest potential  and that we achieved this by becoming aware of aspects of ourselves we ignore or are unconscious to, aswell as the unmanifested potential that exists within us. 
For Jung, healing was a process of reconnecting with our true nature and rediscovering our unique and personal interests, desires and ways of being in the world.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The younger you and the authentic self </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Under the many layers of our identity and our personality is our true self, this part of us never changes and exists throughout our life as our innermost being. It exists independently of our thoughts, feelings and roles that we play in the world. When we are connected with our authentic self, we are able to live freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, we accept our qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who we most essentially are.</p>

<p>Throughout our lives, we change and adapt parts of ourself to maintain our relationships with others and to fit in to what we think other people want us to be. This part of the module explores the conflict we can all experience between wanting to be true to ourselves and wanting to fit in with the world around us.</p>

As young children, we do not change or adapt our behaviour for others but express our needs, interests and sense of self authentically. 
By reconnecting with our younger self, we can discover and reintegrate lost qualities of ourselves and bring them into our present lives more fully. This is a therapeutic process that can help us to develop our self awareness and self esteem.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Personality comes from the greek word, ‘persona’ which means mask. Our personality refers to the different faces that we show to the world and the many different ways we behave, speak, think and relate with other people. Behind our personality is our true Self, which does not change over time or adapt to different circumstances, but contains our essential nature.</p>

<p>Sub personalities are distinct personality structures that we identify with and act out. Sub personalities develop when we feel we cannot express our true nature and need to adapt or change some aspect of ourselves to be loved, accepted and acknowledged. Sub personalities are not bad or something to be removed, they are a very normal part of psychological development as they allow us to survive and adapt to an unpredictable social world.

  <h2 class="slide-title">The psychology of Sub-personalities </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Subpersonalities are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have followed since childhood</p>

<p>When people fail to respond empathetically to our true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents or our environment need us to be. A psychotherapist called Winnicott, called this process of adapting, the development of the ‘False Self’. It is also referred to as the Survival Personality. </p>

<p>These are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that we develop to adapt to various environments where we feel unable to be our authentic self. In neuroscience these are viewed as distinct neural networks that function as ‘specialised selves’ or ‘self states’. ( Siegel 1993)</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Daniel Stern summarises the psychological view on these multiple selves: ‘ It is now largely accepted that there are multiple ( context -specific) selves that can interact with each other, observe each other, and converse together out of consciousness. This is normal, not limited to pathological dissociative states.’ (Stern 2004) </p>

<p>Sub-personality theory explains personality development and helps to explain why parts of our personality can feel conflicted and as if there are ‘multiple selves’ within us who have different ways of being.</p>

<p>For example the feeling of ‘ I want to do this but another part of me wants to do that’, or ‘ I shouldn’t be getting angry right now but I think its important I tell the truth’</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">How are sub-personalities related to mental health? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Subpersonalities cause us difficulties when we identify with this one part of ourselves and believe it to be all of us. For example, if we are identified with the ‘ High achiever’ part of ourselves, it may help us to get good grades and maintain a motivation for developing our knowledge and experience. However, if we become over identified with this part of ourselves we may become very distressed by setbacks, we may spend less time with our friends or we may never be satisfied with what we have achieved. 
 
Our sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need. By exploring these parts of ourselves, we can develop our self awareness and integrate the many different parts of ourselves. You can imagine your sub-personalities as an orchestra and your awareness as the conductor. By bringing awareness to your different sub personalities you can integrate them and enable them to work together as a harmonious whole.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">What are the benefits of sub-personality work? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p> 	1.	We learn to connect with our different and contradictory ways of acting in the world. This raises our awareness of our behaviour and helps us to make sense of how we can seem to be different versions of ourselves in different circumstances.  
	2.	We learn to free ourselves of the unconscious forces that cause us to get trapped in certain aspects of our personality. For example, a very critical part of ourselves.  
	3.	We integrate the different aspects of our personality which causes us to feel less conflict within ourselves.  
	4.	We emphasise all of the beneficial qualities of our sub-personalities and recognise how they serve us.  
	5.	By identifying with our different sub-peronalities, it allows us to develop a greater awareness of what is our true self and what is a mask or persona.  </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Group Identity  </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Values, Beliefs and Behaviour  </p>

<p>One of the strongest factors that influence and reflect our sense of identity are the groups that we are a part of in our lives. From the moment we are born, we are a part of our family group. As we grow and develop, we encounter new groups at school or in our local community. Throughout our whole lives, out of choice or out of circumstance, we will spend our times in groups that have an influence on us and which reflect our values, beliefs and mindsets about who we are. Groups provide us with a sense of belonging, which is one of our most important needs in terms of our mental health and wellbeing. </p>

<p>Research has shown consistently that the quality of our social world is one of the most significant indicators of our wellbeing and ability to recover from difficult times in our lives.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>‘ Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.’
