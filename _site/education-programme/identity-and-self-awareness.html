  <h2 class="slide-title">So what is self awareness? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Self awareness is the experience of noticing our thoughts, feelings and behaviour, as if we are an observer.</p>

<p>It also allows us to step back and understand both ourselves and how we are in relationship with others.</p>

<p>By developing our levels of self awareness, we can access a sense of choice around how we respond to life’s challenges. Over time, we can experience a deep connection with our most authentic self.</p>

<p>The <strong>insights</strong> that self awareness provides us with allow us to feel more satisfied with our lives because we become more aware of why we feel and act the way we do.</p>

<p>When cultivated fully, we no longer feel the need to repress or hide our emotions or react unconsciously to our experiences but view ourselves with a deeper level of understanding.</p>

<p>The Johari Window is a visual representation of the parts of ourselves that are  either known or unknown to ourselves and others.</p>

<p><strong>The open area</strong> represents everything we know about ourselves. This is what people know about us and what we are consciously aware of too.</p>

<p><strong>The hidden area</strong> relates to all of the parts of ourselves that we do not share with others. This information that we keep private may relate to our fears and insecurities swell as your hopes and dreams.</p>

<p><strong>The blind spot</strong> relates to the parts of ourselves we are not aware of but that others know about us. This can relate to both our positive attributes and areas for growth.</p>

<p><strong>The unknown</strong> relates to information about ourselves that is unconscious to both ourselves and others. This relates to parts of ourselves we still have yet to discover through new experiences.</p>

<p>He believed that everybody had the ability and the impulse to move towards their fullest potential  and that this was achieved by becoming aware of the aspects of ourselves that we often ignore or are unconscious to.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">What is our authentic self ? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Under the many layers of our identity and our personality is our true self, this part of us never changes but exists throughout our life as our innermost being. It exists independently of our thoughts, feelings and roles that we play in the world. When we are connected with our authentic self, we are able to live freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, we accept our qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who we most essentially are.</p>

<p>Throughout our lives, we change and adapt parts of ourself to maintain our relationships with others and to fit in to who we think other people want us to be. We can all experience this conflict between wanting to be true to ourselves and wanting to fit in with the world around us.</p>

<p>This next part of the module will explore the authentic self and how we develop the different ‘masks’ or sub-personalities that we show to the world.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Personality </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Personality comes from the greek word ‘persona’ which means mask.</p>

<p>Our personality refers to the different ways we express ourselves in the world and the many different ways we relate with other people. Together with our personality we all have an unchanging part of who we are that psychologists call the ‘Self’. This is the part of us that does not change over time or adapt to different circumstances, but is our essential nature.</p>

<p>Our Self is the part of us that is spontaneous and loving, that seeks to be known and is the experience of who we most fundamentally are.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The psychology of Sub-personalities </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Subpersonalities are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have followed since childhood</p>

<p>When people fail to respond empathetically to our true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents or our environment need us to be.</p>

<p>A psychotherapist called Winnicott also called this process of adapting, the development of the False Self. It has also been referred to as the Survival Personality or ‘Character Armour’. </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>They are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that we develop to adapt to various environments where we feel unable to be our authentic self.</p>

<p>In neuroscience these are viewed as distinct neural networks that function as ‘specialised selves’ or ‘self states’. ( Siegel 1993)</p>

<p>Sub-personality theory explains personality development and helps to explain why parts of our personality can feel conflicted and as if there are ‘multiple selves’ within us who have different ways of being.</p>

<p>For example the feeling of ‘ I want to do this but another part of me wants to do that’, or ‘ I shouldn’t be getting angry right now but I think its important I tell the truth’</p>

  <li>
    <p>We learn to connect with our different and contradictory ways of acting in the world. This raises our awareness of our behaviour and helps us to make sense of how we can seem to be different versions of ourselves in different circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We learn to free ourselves of the unconscious forces that cause us to get trapped in certain aspects of our personality. For example, a very critical part of ourselves.We integrate the different aspects of our personality which causes us to feel less conflict within ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We emphasise all of the beneficial qualities of our sub-personalities and recognise how they serve us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By identifying with our different sub-peronalities, it allows us to develop a greater awareness of what is our true self and what is a mask or persona.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">How are sub-personalities related to mental health? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Subpersonalities cause us difficulties when we identify with this one part of ourselves and believe it to be all of us. For example, if we are identified with the ‘ High achiever’ part of ourselves, it may help us to get good grades and maintain a motivation for developing our knowledge and experience. However, if we become over identified with this part of ourselves we may become very distressed by setbacks, we may spend less time with our friends or we may never be satisfied with what we have achieved. </p>

<p>Our sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need. By exploring these parts of ourselves, we can develop our self awareness and integrate the many different parts of ourselves. You can imagine your sub-personalities as an orchestra and your awareness as the conductor. By bringing awareness to your different sub personalities you can integrate them and enable the different parts of your personality to work together as a harmonious whole.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>“ Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance. ”</p>

            <p>Description: We live in a social world and many aspects of our personalities are shaped by the social relationships and situations we encounter throughout our lives. 

As it is impossible for our close relationships to be fully present all the time and for us to be completely present to others, we fit our environments by adapting our personality to defend ourselves or meet our needs for connection.
  
An example of this is noticing when somebody seems to have a different personality depending on what group they are in, or when we notice we behave differently depending on who we are with. 

This is a completely normal process but understanding the process behind it can help us develop an awareness of how parts of our identity are shaped by our desire to fit in and be accepted in contrast to expressing our authentic self. </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p><strong>Values, Beliefs and Behaviour</strong></p>

<p>One of the strongest factors that influence and reflect our sense of identity are the groups that we are a part of in our lives.</p>

<p>From the moment we are born, we are a part of our family group. As we grow and develop, we encounter new groups at school or in our local community.</p>

<p>Throughout our whole lives, out of choice or out of circumstance, we will spend our times in groups that have an influence on us and which reflect our values, beliefs and mindsets about who we are.</p>

<p>Groups provide us with a sense of belonging, which is one of our most important needs in terms of our mental health and wellbeing. </p>

<p>Research has shown consistently that the quality of our social world is one of the most significant indicators of our wellbeing and ability to recover from difficult times in our lives.</p>
