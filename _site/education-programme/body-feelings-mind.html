  <h2 class="slide-title">How effective are mind-body techniques? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>Mind body techniques have been shown to improve depression in both children and adults.</p>

<p>In one study, 129 Palestinian children and teenagers took part in a 10-week mind-body skills programme that included meditation, breathing techniques and self expression through drawings and movement. After the programme the participants reported feeling significantly less feelings of hopelessness (a common experience in depression).</p>

<p>The young people experienced improvements in their depression after 7 months, despite continuing to live through conflict and adversity.</p>

<p>Further research has shown that mind-body techniques enable higher levels of self awareness, motivation and improvements in mood and behaviour.</p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Interoception is a skill that allows us to perceive our internal states and sensations of our body, feelings and mind. It is a skill that provides us with a starting point for regulating our moods, thoughts and physical health.</p>

<p>By bringing awareness to the state of our body, feelings and mind, through the process of interoception, we can reduce the intensity of the distress and discomfort that we experience.</p>

<p>When we turn towards our discomfort, with an attitude of curiosity and acceptance, we begin to develop the ability to regulate and reduce it.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Vagus Nerve</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>The vagus nerve is the part of our body that is responsible for a large part of the mind-body connection.</p>

<p>The vagus nerve sends messages between our internal body parts and our brain, sending messages back and forth that affect the functioning of our physical body and mental states.</p>

<p>When the vagus nerve is not activated enough, our brain can become overstimulated, causing mental tension, anxiety and rumination. </p>

<p>We notice the effect of the vagus nerve when we do things that relieve physical tension and our minds become more relaxed and focused.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">How else is the vagus nerve related to our mental health? </h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><h1 id="experiencing-a-threat">Experiencing a Threat</h1>

<p>When we experience a threat, the vagus nerve sends a message to our digestive system to stop producing digestive enzymes and to stop ourselves feeling hungry so that we can focus our energy and resources on responding to the threat around us. This is why when we feel stressed and anxious, we feel butterflies in our stomach and other uncomfortable feelings in our belly. </p>

<h1 id="feelings-stressed-and-overwhelmed">Feelings Stressed and Overwhelmed</h1>

<p>When we are stressed and overwhelmed, we are more likely to become ill and are vulnerable to catching a cold or suffering from other illnesses related to the immune system. When the parasympathetic nervous system is active, it suppresses the immune response in the body.</p>

<h1 id="health-problems-and-inflammation">Health problems and inflammation</h1>

<p>When the calming effects of the vagus nerve are inhibited through stress, our body can experience inflammation and this can lead to a range of health conditions. There is an extensive body of research that links inflammation to chronic health conditions. Stress impairs functioning of the nervous system which produces this inflammation and therefore it is important to use the body’s natural mechanism - breathing, to maintain balance and bring the balance of the body back to its healthy state. </p>

<p>When we breathe deeply, our diaphragm presses against the vagus nerve. This nerve is responsible for sending impulses to the brain and signals to our mind it can relax.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Movement and emotions</h2>
  <div class="slide-description"><p>When we experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected in our body as tension and discomfort. We can release this tension and discomfort by bringing awareness to our body and physical experience.</p>

<p>One of the ways we manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into our minds. Often we don’t realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to bring awareness to ourselves in the present moment and reconnect with our bodies as a way to calm ourselves and rebalance our mood.</p>

<p>Dance movement psychotherapy is effective because it allows us to learn how this process works as it allows us to experience the power of how we can use our bodies to influence our mood and release trapped and difficult emotions. </p>

  <div class="slide-description">
<p>The first lesson in using the mind is to observe its tendency to become distracted by intruding thoughts. </p>

<p>By eliminating distractions, you will be able to observe the mind with greater clarity. We will start with simple exercises to help you understand this. </p>

<p>Our mind likes to comment on our experiences. It comments on everything, from how we are feeling, to what we think about other people and the experiences we have. When we say we feel like ‘changing our mind’ it is because the feelings that we are having are causing us to have different thoughts about the same situation.</p>

<p>The mind is always changing because our moods are always changing. We run into problems with the mind when we begin to believe that everything we are thinking is the only experience that is possible. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Understanding the nature of the mind </h2>
  <div class="slide-description">
<p>Often, we do not realise how much our mind and thoughts have an impact on how we are feeling. By bringing awareness to the nature of our mind and by understanding how to control its different aspects, we can dramatically improve the quality of our lives. </p>

<p>This part of the course is designed to teach you how to examine and gain more awareness of your mind and thought processes.</p>

<p>There is a tendency for the mind to become distracted, which makes us feel lost and unclear about what we want to focus on.</p>

<p>To train the mind, we must learn how to control our attention and bring balance to it’s different tendencies so that we can use the mind, instead of allowing ourselves to become stuck in autopilot. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Rumination </h2>
  <div class="slide-description">
<p>In Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms. One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress, Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.</p>

<p>Rumination happens when we become caught in a particular story about our lives which limits our focus to repetitive thought patterns.</p>

<p>High levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety and low mood. </p>

<p>When we ruminate, we often feel trapped in our thinking and can’t see a way out. This makes us feel low and makes us believe that our life is our thoughts. But this is not the case.</p>

<p>Our mind is just one part of our experience and we can use it in many different ways. </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing our awareness to the present moment consciously and non-judgementally.</p>

<p>Often, our thoughts become preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on our past or overanalysing our personal experiences.</p>

<p>Through mindfulness, we can ‘step back’ and become attuned to our present moment experience and step back from our attachment to thinking.</p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">The rational mind</h2>
  <div class="slide-description">
<p>When you create from the rational mind, things seem very factual and concrete. This is really helpful for answering questions and providing information for other people to understand. You can use your rational mind to convey your thoughts in a way that is simple and clear.</p>

<p>The rational mind is also really helpful for communicating things you have already learned and want to tell to others.</p>

<p>This is why people often get into arguments when they use their rational mind because they are communicating different things that they understand but not considering other possibilities with their imagination. </p>

  <h2 class="slide-title">Getting stuck in the rational</h2>
  <div class="slide-description">
<p>Sometimes the rational mind can get so caught up in facts and information that we already know or want to understand that we forget to use our imagination to consider how it can be used in other ways and also how other people have made sense of the information from their own perspective.</p>

<p>Everybody has a different perspective and so information can seem very different to different people. The way that you interpret the information depends on who is teaching you, your experiences of the information before and what you want to use the information to do.</p>

<p>If you want to use the information to add to your beliefs about something then this means that you will often learn the information in a way that serves your beliefs, rather than in a way that can be discussed and changes over time. </p>

<p>This part of the mind is much softer and it enjoys working in ways that are more imaginative, like storytelling. </p>

  <div class="slide-description"><p>Whenever somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps us to imagine future possibilities and helps us to access parts of our experience we have not yet seen. When we close our eyes and allow ourselves to imagine something, it helps us to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening. </p>

<p>When we get stuck with a decision, it’s because we feel like we don’t know what the outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people we are having the problem with, we can visualise other aspects that we can’t access when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one belief or potential situation. </p>

<p>Letter writing, or journaling has been found to be a really effective way to identify and process our emotional world.</p>

<p>This letter writing exercise is focused on expressing our emotions towards other people but we can also journal about our own thoughts and feelings to help us make sense of them.</p>

<p>The process works in a similar way to communicating with words, as we are externalising our distress which allows us to view it in a new way.</p>
