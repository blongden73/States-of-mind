“ Young people aren't listened to because of what they are: Young. 

Many people consider youth to be something that's synonymous with a lack of understanding, a lack of the ability to be independent; to think independently and to act with surety in what you know. That's not true. Young people change and grow all of the time, but one thing that remains with them is the fundamental belief in who they are and who they want to be - that's one of the most valuable things that a young person can contribute to the world around them. “
