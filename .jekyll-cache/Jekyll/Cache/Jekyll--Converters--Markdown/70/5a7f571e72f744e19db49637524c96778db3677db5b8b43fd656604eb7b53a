I"<p>Setting boundaries is a tool that is important in all of your relationships.</p>

<p>If you did not learn to set boundaries in childhood, it is important to do so in adulthood, so that you can clearly express your feelings and needs. Setting healthy boundaries helps you to communicate what types of behaviour you will/ will not tolerate from others by stating what is and is not acceptable to you.</p>

<p>By setting boundaries you can improve your self esteem and prevent difficult feelings of resentment, anger and stress from emerging in your relationships.</p>

<p>When healthy boundaries are present, each person understands that they are responsible for advocating for their own needs in relationships and communicating clearly so that other people understand what they need.</p>
