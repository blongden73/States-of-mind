<p>Mental health concerns are
often spoken about as isolated
and individual problems. But
we believe they are inseparable
from the social contexts in
which we grow. With levels of
distress rising, itâ€™s clear we
need to rethink how our society
supports emotional and mental
wellbeing.</p>

<p>Growing up, we often have little
space to openly explore how our
social world and experiences of
life impact our sense of who we
are. We work in schools and
communities, creating spaces
for those experiences to be
heard. Exploring issues from
a psychological perspective,
we aim to help young people
understand their mental health
in new ways and overcome the
idea that they are flawed or
different for struggling with
lifeâ€™s challenges.</p>

<p>We believe in hope and
opportunity amidst chaos
and uncertainty. Our mission
is bring hope to the lives
of young people in our
society and create a future
that values the beauty and
complexity of the human
experience.</p>
