I"ž<p>Martin Buber Martin Buber was a prominent twentieth century philosopher, religious thinker, political activist and educator. 
He explored different ways that people perceived and acted towards other people in their relationships. He called these different ways of viewing others in relationship as â€˜I-Thouâ€™ and â€˜I-itâ€™ relationships. 
In an I-Thou relationship, the other person is seen for who they really are, not for what they represent or signify. In this relationships, there is a willingness to understand the other person on a deeper level than our immediate judgements, assumptions and stereotypes that we bring to the relationship. 
In an I-It relationship, we view the other person more as a â€˜thingâ€™ than a human being with a story and individual needs. In and I-it relationship we assume we know the other person, without needing to take time to develop a close and mutual relationship with them.</p>
