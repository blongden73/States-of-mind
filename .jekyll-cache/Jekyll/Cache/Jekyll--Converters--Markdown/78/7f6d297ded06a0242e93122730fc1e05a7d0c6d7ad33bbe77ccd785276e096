I"µ<p>The anxiety response begins in a part of the brain called the Amygdala. The amygdala is activated in response to situations of fear and uncertainty.</p>

<p>We share this part of the brain with all animals, as it is one of the most fundamental survival systems that allows us to detect threats in our environment.</p>

<p>Animal studies have shown that if you remove the amygdala, the animal loses any sense of fear or anxiety.Â </p>
