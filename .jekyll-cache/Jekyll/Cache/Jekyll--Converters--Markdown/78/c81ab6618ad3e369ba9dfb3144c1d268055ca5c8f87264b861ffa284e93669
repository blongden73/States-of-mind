<p>Safeguarding the wellbeing of young people is fundamental to our approach. We aim to both protect users from harm and ensure that their right to confidentiality is properly upheld, in keeping with the law and good practice guidance.</p>

<p>Our approach</p>

<p>While most of our users simply need a little extra advice or support, some are more vulnerable. We have procedures in place to safeguard the welfare of all our users in line with our commitment to enabling young people to be curious, open and reflect honestly about their experiences without harm or fear of reprisal.</p>

<p>The States of Mind Online education programme incorporates a sophisticated system for monitoring and tracking potential safeguarding risks.</p>

<p>The system is based on best practices used in other confidential helplines.</p>

<p>This enables us to spot patterns of concern as well as issues that must be dealt with immediately.</p>

<p>Our commitment to confidentiality</p>

<p>Young people have told us that confidentiality is one of their top concerns when seeking answers to private or personal questions or problems. Perceived lack of confidentiality significantly deters young people from seeking support and advice from teachers, peers, parents or support agencies.</p>

<p>Upholding young peopleâ€™s right to confidentiality, except when they are at risk of serious harm, is a crucial factor in supporting young peopleâ€™s access to high quality confidential services that can promote wellbeing. It encourages the development of a relationship of trust that enables young people to talk freely and honestly about their situation. This enables us to assess whether the individuals are at risk of harm and take appropriate steps to safeguard their well-being.</p>

<p>Confidentiality at States of Mind means that no identifiable information about any individual is disclosed or passed to anyone, or any agency outside States of Mind, other than in the most exceptional circumstances. See our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for more information on how we use data.</p>

<p>States of Mind recognises legal restrictions such as the age of consent or the use of alcohol, tobacco or drugs and where appropriate we will offer guidance and support on health and safety. However, in line with our confidentiality policy, we would not necessarily refer young people to the authorities unless we felt that they were at risk of harming themselves or others.</p>

<p>States of Mind is not a crisis or emergency service. If your post suggests that you might be at risk of harm or harming others, in accordance with our safeguarding policy, we will send you a message with guidance on how you can get help and may notify a safeguarding officer in your school or college.</p>
