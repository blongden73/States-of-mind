<p>Often, we do not realise how much our mind and thoughts have an impact on how we are feeling. By bringing awareness to the nature of our mind and by understanding how to control its different aspects, we can dramatically improve the quality of our lives.Â </p>

<p>This part of the course is designed to teach you how to examine and gain more awareness of your mind and thought processes.</p>

<p>There is a tendency for the mind to become distracted, which makes us feel lost and unclear about what we want to focus on. To train the mind, we must learn how to control our attention and bring balance to itâ€™s different tendencies so that we can use the mind, instead of allowing ourselves to become stuck in autopilot.Â </p>
