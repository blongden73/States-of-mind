I"ç<p>The inner child is a psychological practice that allows us to reconnect with our essential nature. 
As young children, we do not change or adapt our behaviour for others but express our needs, interests and sense of self authentically. 
By reconnecting with our younger self, we can discover and reintegrate lost qualities of ourselves and bring them into our present lives more fully. This is a therapeutic process that can help us to develop our self awareness and self esteem.</p>
