I"Ç<p>A) I find it relatively easy to get close to others and I feel relatively comfortable depending on them and allowing them to depend on me.  I donâ€™t worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me. 
B) I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesnâ€™t love me or wonâ€™t want to stay with me. I want to get close to my partner and this sometimes scares people away. 
C) I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others. I find it difficult to trust them completely and difficult to allow myself to defend on them. I am nervous when anybody gets too close and people want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.</p>
