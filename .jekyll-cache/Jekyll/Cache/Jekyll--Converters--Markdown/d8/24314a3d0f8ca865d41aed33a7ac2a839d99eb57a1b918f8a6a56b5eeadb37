I"¸<p>At States of Mind, we run research and social change projects that enable young peopleâ€™s voices to inform the way emotional and mental wellbeing is supported in society. As part of this work, last year we asked a group of London students about their experiences in education. The students explored the subject in a series of focus groups, and shared their findings in a letter to the Chief Inspector of Education, Amanda Spielman.</p>
