I"Û<p>Neuroscientists have identified a distinct neural network in your brain that is activated when you ruminate called the â€˜Default Mode Networkâ€™ .</p>

<p>When your â€˜Default Modeâ€™ Network is active, it may look like nothing is happening from the outside but actually inside your mind, you will be daydreaming, reflecting or thinking about your life.</p>

<p>The default mode is active when you are worrying or preoccupied with thoughts about the past and future.</p>
