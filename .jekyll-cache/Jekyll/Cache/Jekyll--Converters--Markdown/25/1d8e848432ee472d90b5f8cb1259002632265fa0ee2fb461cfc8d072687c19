<p>When you imagine an aspect of a future situation that you feel you canâ€™t cope with, your mind tries to solve the problem by thinking about it. This can cause a â€˜Thought Loopâ€™ that is caused by your thoughts triggering more feelings of stress and anxiety, that in turn fuel more thoughts and stronger emotions.</p>

<p>This process of overthinking is called â€˜ Ruminationâ€™.</p>

<p>The word comes from the word â€˜ruminateâ€™ which is the continued chewing motion that animals use to digest their food. You can think of rumination as the process of â€˜chewing on our thoughtsâ€™.Â </p>

<p>Research has shown that people who ruminate more are more likely to struggle with anxiety and depression.</p>
