I"?<p>The anxiety response is kept going when we avoid our feelings through escaping to our mind ( rumination ).<br />
Self compassion involves bringing awareness to our discomfort and distress and understanding that our pain and suffering is a normal part of being human. 
By bringing an attitude of care and acceptance towards ourselves, we can focus our energy away from our worries and concerns, towards a dedicated attempt to reassure and support ourselves. 
By turning towards our feelings, instead of resisting them, we can begin to self soothe and calm our anxiety.</p>
