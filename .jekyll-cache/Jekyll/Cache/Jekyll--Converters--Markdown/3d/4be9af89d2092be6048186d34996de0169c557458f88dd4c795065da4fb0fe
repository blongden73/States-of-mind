I"<p>Setting boundaries is a tool that is important in all of our relationships.</p>

<p>If we did not learn to set boundaries in childhood, it is important to do so in adulthood, so that we can clearly express our feelings and needs. Setting healthy boundaries helps us to communicate what types of behaviour we will/ will not tolerate from others by stating what is and is not acceptable to you.</p>

<p>By setting boundaries we can improve our self esteem and prevent difficult feelings of resentment, anger and stress from emerging in our relationships.</p>

<p>When healthy boundaries are present, each person understands that they are responsible for advocating for their own needs in relationships and communicating clearly so that other people understand what they neeed.</p>
