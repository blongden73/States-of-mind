I"¹<p>People often rely on relationships with other people to help regulate their emotions but in the absence of these supportive environments it is important to find healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions on our own.</p>

<p>Letter writing, or journaling has been found to be a really effective way to identify and process your emotional world.</p>

<p>This letter writing exercise is focused on expressing your emotions towards other people but you can also journal about your own thoughts and feelings to help you make sense of them.</p>

<p>The process works in a similar way to communicating with words, as you are externalising your distress which allows you to view it in a new way.</p>
