<p>Our world needs the thinkers,
do-ers and leaders of tomorrow
to feel like theyâ€™ve got this.</p>

<p>But in a rapidly changing world,
being young and transitioning into
adult life is more challenging than
ever. We believe there are better ways of supporting young peopleâ€™s
wellbeing, and weâ€™ll only find it by
fully engaging them in the process
of change.</p>
