I"o<p>If our relationship pattern is causing us to experience unfulfilling relationships or we are struggling to experience closeness in our relationships, self-compassion is an important tool for caring for ourselves and supporting our mental health. Without self-compassion we can reinforce limiting beliefs that we are unlovable and incapable of experiencing intimacy and closeness in relationships.</p>

<p>When we experience conflict or challenges in our relationships it causes our nervous systems to react, due to an evolutionary fear of rejection, abandonment and isolation.</p>

<p>By practicing self compassion we can provide ourselves with the need for reassurance and a sense of safety in the absence of another person.</p>

  <li>Notice the critical inner narrative</li>
  <li>Notice the tension in your body created by these critical thoughts and beliefs</li>
  <li>Bring awareness to the areas of tension without resisting them</li>
  <li>Breathe softly to these areas of tension to help release the built up stress and tension</li>
  <li>Replace critical thoughts with supportive and reassuring statements</li>
