I"¢<p>The size of the amygdala has been shown to correlate with peopleâ€™s sensitivity to aspects of the environment they consider as threatening or unsafe.<br />
This is believed to be caused by past experiences of stress and fear that causes the brain to adapt to become more alert to future instances of threat so that we can recognise them more easily.
Research has shown that mindfulness and stress reduction programmes reduce the size of the amygalda and peopleâ€™s levels of anxiety in situations previously experienced as threatening.  The size of the amygdala is correlated with the degree to which people subjectively experience the world as safe or threatening.</p>
