I"‚<p>Drawing is a powerful tool for getting in touch with our emotional world. Often if our lives are busy and we are very caught in our thoughts, it can be difficult to step back and observe how our feelings and emotions are. If our feelings get trapped or ignored it can contribute to a lot of tension and discomfort. This activity allows you to gently connect with your feelings in a therapeutic way, using a simple drawing exercise. This activity can be used alone or in groups to calm your mind and allow you to express the emotions you are carrying in any given moment.Â </p>

<p>As you do this exercise, memories and associations may emerge related to your feelings. This is completely normal and a part of what happens when you become attuned to your emotional world. Just allow this process to unfold and stay with whatever feelings and sensations emerge for you as you do the exercise.</p>
