<p>2020/21 - Designing an alternative education evaluation framework</p>

<p>In this phase, a new cohort of young people studied the current Ofsted framework, alongside national and international research around education evaluation. Subsequently, they co-interviewed Headteachers, former Ofsted inspectors, academics and others alongside a doctorate researcher who fully documented the process. The group then drafted an evaluation framework called the â€˜Review for Progress and Developmentâ€™ (RPD). For a fuller summary of the direction of phases three and four, see <a href="https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/11/18/education-inspection-students.html">here</a>. The RPD differs hugely from Ofstedâ€™s external accountability, focussing instead on school self-evaluation and collaborative evaluation across school networks. The final draft is a work in progress and a documentary is currently being edited that followed the project over the course of the year. It will be shared very soon!</p>

<p>At our <a href="https://www.educationfuturesinaction.com/schedule-1">Education Futures in Action</a> conference in July 2021, co-organised alongside UCL, young innovators from States of Mind presented their evidence-based ideas around educational transformation with candour and eloquence. Three leaders of the Breaking the Silence project have presented their ideas at various national conferences and to the Education Select Committee.</p>
