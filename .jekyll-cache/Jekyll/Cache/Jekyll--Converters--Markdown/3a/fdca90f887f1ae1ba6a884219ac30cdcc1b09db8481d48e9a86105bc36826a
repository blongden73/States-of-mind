I"<p>When we are distressed, distracted or experiencing conflict in our relationships, it affects our capacity to consider that another person’s experience is different to our own.</p>

<p>Without open communication, we make guesses and assumptions about what is going on in other people’s minds.</p>

<p>We assume that other people think in the way that we do.</p>

<p>We project our own feelings and past experiences onto other people.</p>

<p>We make quick decisions about the meaning of other people’s behaviour without taking time to check it out with them.</p>

<p>We do not take time to consider how other people have different experiences than our own.</p>

<p>When people are threatened they may hold back their feelings and thoughts about a situation.</p>
