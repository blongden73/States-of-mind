I"/<p>The attunement that our supportive relationships provide, supports our personal development by reflecting back to us and reinforcing our values, goals, beliefs and worldview.<br />
Our supportive relationships act as a mirror for us to see ourselves authentically. 
These supportive relationships provide a structure of support that ‘hold’ us and support our sense of confidence and self esteem. 
These relationships can be with members of our community, teachers, family friends, coaches or anybody with whom we have a close healthy relationship.</p>
