I"á<p>A Psychologist called Donald Winnicott coined this term to refer to the fact that no parent can meet our needs all of the time and that no parenting style can be completely perfect.</p>

<p>Our parents are individuals with their own potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from their childhoods.</p>

<p>Although no parent can meet all of our needs all of the time, the amount of attunement that they were able to provide has been shown to influence the quality of our relationships as an adult.</p>

<p>If our parents punished us or were unavailable when we needed them emotionally, we may come to develop a belief that it is unsafe or uncomfortable expressing our needs with others as adults.</p>
