I"<p>Whenever somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps us to imagine future possibilities and helps us to access parts of our experience we have not yet seen. When we close our eyes and allow ourselves to imagine something, it helps us to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening. </p>

<p>When we get stuck with a decision, it’s because we feel like we don’t know what the outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people we are having the problem with, we can visualise other aspects that we can’t access when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one belief or potential situation. </p>
