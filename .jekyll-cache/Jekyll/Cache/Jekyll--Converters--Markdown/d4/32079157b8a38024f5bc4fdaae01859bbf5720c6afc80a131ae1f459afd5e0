I"ù<p>Anxiety is a natural response to feelings of fear.</p>

<p>This fear response is a natural defence mechanism that manifests in the way we think, feel and behave.</p>

<p>Anxiety can help us by making us alert us to potential threats and dangerous situations. For example if we are walking down an unfamiliar road late at night, it is very natural to feel edge, nervous and to consider the potential risks.</p>
