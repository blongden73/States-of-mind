I"<p>Our Threat system is the system that we have been exploring in this module. It is responsible for alerting us to danger or potential threats and causes us to react in a defensive way when we feel we cannot cope with a situation.</p>

<p>This part of us protects us from harm. When it is overactive, it causes us to feel withdrawn, avoidant and fearful of the events and people in our lives who we perceive as unsafe. We can get stuck in a defensive mode that prevents us from experiencing life to the full.
