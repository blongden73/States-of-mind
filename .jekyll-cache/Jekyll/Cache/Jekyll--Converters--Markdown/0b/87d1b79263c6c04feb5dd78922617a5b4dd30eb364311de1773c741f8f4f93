I"ø<p>Daniel Stern summarises the psychological view on these multiple selves: â€˜ It is now largely accepted that there are multiple ( context -specific) selves that can interact with each other, observe each other, and converse together out of consciousness. This is normal, not limited to pathological dissociative states.â€™ (Stern 2004)Â </p>

<p>Sub-personality theory explains personality development and helps to explain why parts of our personality can feel conflicted and as if there are â€˜multiple selvesâ€™ within us who have different ways of being.</p>

<p>For example the feeling of â€˜ I want to do this but another part of me wants to do thatâ€™, or â€˜ I shouldnâ€™t be getting angry right now but I think its important I tell the truthâ€™</p>
