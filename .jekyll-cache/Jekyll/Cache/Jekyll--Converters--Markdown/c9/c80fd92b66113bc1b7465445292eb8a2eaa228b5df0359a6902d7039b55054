I"g<p><strong>Values, Beliefs and Behaviour</strong></p>

<p>One of the strongest factors that influence and reflect our sense of identity are the groups that we are a part of in our lives.</p>

<p>From the moment we are born, we are a part of our family group. As we grow and develop, we encounter new groups at school or in our local community. Throughout our whole lives, out of choice or out of circumstance, we will spend our times in groups that have an influence on us and which reflect our values, beliefs and mindsets about who we are.</p>

<p>Groups provide us with a sense of belonging, which is one of our most important needs in terms of our mental health and wellbeing. Research has shown consistently that the quality of our social world is one of the most significant indicators of our wellbeing and ability to recover from difficult times in our lives.</p>
