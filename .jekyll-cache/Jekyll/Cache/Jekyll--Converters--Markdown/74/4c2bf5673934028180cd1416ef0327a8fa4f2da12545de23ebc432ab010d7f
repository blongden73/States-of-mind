I"<p>The inner child practice is a therapeutic process that allows you to reconnect with your essential nature.</p>

<p>As a young child, you do not change or adapt your behaviour for others but express your needs, interests and sense of self authentically.</p>

<p>By reconnecting with your younger self, you can discover and reclaim lost qualities of yourself and bring them into your present life to help you.</p>

<p>This is a therapeutic process that can help you to develop your self awareness and self esteem.</p>
