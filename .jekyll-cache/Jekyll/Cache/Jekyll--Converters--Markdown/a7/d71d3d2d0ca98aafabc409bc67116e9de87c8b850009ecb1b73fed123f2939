</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Felt constantly threatened (repeated job loss, poverty, homelessness, out of sync with mainstream &amp; workplace values, relationship failure, social pariah): low mood, worry, mental and physical activation, weird appetite and sleep</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Felt out of options (low physical, material and social resources; tired all the time, brain not functioning): hopelessness, sadness, despair, indecision</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gas pedal/sympathetic (constant pressure to do something to fix it): worry, activation, insomnia, eating for energy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brake/parasympathetic (no clue how to fix it, where to turn or if it would ever get better): Low energy, low mood, low appetite and low interest in life; digestive troubles, stomach cramps, poor thinking and concentration; leaden limbs, sleeping a lot</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Life indefinitely stalled by Brake (wasting my life, leaving a legacy of suffering and pain, letting myself and others down): Worthlessness, emptiness, guilt, indecision, crying a lot, preoccupied with death and suicide</p>
  </li>
</ol>
