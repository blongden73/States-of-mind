I"r<p>The vagus nerve causes a response in the heart, lungs and gut, which is triggered by a release of adrenaline and cortisol, two hormones that are connected with the threat response.</p>

<p>This causes our heart to beat faster, our breathing to become more shallow and a sensation of ‘butterflys in the stomach’.</p>

<p>The higher levels of adrenaline and cortisol cause us to feel nervous and jittery as they are preparing us to escape the threat (Flight) or become defensive to  it ( Fight). The anxiety response is closely linked with the Freeze response, where we feel paralysed to act in the face of a threat.</p>
