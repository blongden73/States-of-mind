I"<p>**We came into being in 2017, as 
an organisation advocating for 
new ways of thinking about 
mental health. **</p>

<p>Our mission is create a world 
where everyone has the tools to 
maintain a healthy identity as they 
move through life.</p>

<p>And we’re well on our way: 
collaborating with a range of 
London schools and community 
organisations, we’re building a 
model that gives young people an 
opportunity to develop emotional 
intelligence and self awareness as 
part of their everyday life.</p>
