I"<p>Research shows that people are likely to be drawn to people who share the same relationships style as their caregivers.<br />
For example, if our parents were distant or unavailable when we were younger, we may be attracted to people who are avoidant of intimacy and closeness into our adult life as this is the relationship style that we have become familiar with. 
If somebody with an anxious pattern has a relationship with somebody with an avoidant partner, it may cause a ‘push and pull’ dynamic in relationships.</p>
