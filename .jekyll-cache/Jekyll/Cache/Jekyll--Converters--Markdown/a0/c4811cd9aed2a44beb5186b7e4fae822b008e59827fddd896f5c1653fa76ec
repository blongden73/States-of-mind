I"¤<p>What happens in the brain when we experience ruptures in our relationships?Â </p>

<p>Research has shown that when we experience conflict and rupture in our relationships, the same areas of our brain light up as those that are activated when we break a leg or experience physical pain.Â </p>

<p>Wounding in relationshipsÂ </p>

<p>Wounding occurs in relationships when there has been conflict or emotional neglect that has been left unresolved in the relationship. The emotional impact of the wounding causes the person to behave in ways that protect them from further harm.Â </p>

<p>Some examples of patterns of behaviour that emerge from wounding in relationships are:</p>

<p>Avoiding contact with the person who has caused the wounding and withdrawing attention and communication.Â </p>

<p>Acting out and harming the other person out of fear and desperation. This could take the form of abusive text messages, manipulation and blackmail or physical and verbal abuse.Â </p>

<p>Becoming hypervigilant to the actions of the other person and other relationships. Hypervigilance is caused by an overactive nervous response to emotional harm and wounding. Hypervigilance may look like stalking, constantly checking your phone to see if the other person has messaged you or become preoccupied with thoughts about the other person and ruminating about the issue , without seeking to resolve it or repair the issue in their presence.Â Â </p>
