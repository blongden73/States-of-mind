<p>We are here to inspire new ways of thinking about mental health.</p>

<p>For too long, our society has used a medical approach to solve a social problem. We believe young people deserve more. Our work focuses on understanding and addressing the social causes of young people’s distress. We then design new systems of support that can be sustained and replicated.</p>

<p>We work alongside young people, talking, listening and innovating with them. None of us are experts, we are failing, learning and testing our ideas together.</p>
