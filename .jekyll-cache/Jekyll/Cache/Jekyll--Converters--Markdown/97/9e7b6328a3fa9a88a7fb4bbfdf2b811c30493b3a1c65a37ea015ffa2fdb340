I"k<p>Subpersonalities cause difficulties when you identify with this one part of yourself and believe it to be all of you.</p>

<p>For example, if you are identified with the ‘High achiever’ part of yourself, it may help you to get good grades and maintain a motivation for developing your knowledge and experience. However, if you become over identified with this part of yourself you may become very distressed by setbacks, you may spend less time with our friends or you may never be satisfied with what you have achieved. </p>

<p>Your sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need.By identifying these needs you can develop more self awareness and understanding of your behaviour.</p>

<p>By bringing awareness to your different sub personalities you can integrate them and enable the different parts of your personality to work together as a harmonious whole.</p>
