    <p>Researchers have described a stage of the stress response called â€˜Frightâ€™.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a state of intense distress that is triggered when intense fear combines with a sense of being trapped or constrained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If somebody is not able to release energy by escaping or defending themselves from a situation that is highly distressing, the body begins to shut down and our mind and body become â€˜immobileâ€™.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tonic immobility (fright) is almost always displayedÂ when the person is overwhelmed by threat and notÂ allowed and not able to act aggressively ( defend themselves) against the threat.</p>
