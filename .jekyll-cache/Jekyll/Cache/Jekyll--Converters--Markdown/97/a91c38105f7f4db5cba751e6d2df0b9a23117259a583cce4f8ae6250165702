I"P<p>If our relationship pattern is causing us to experience unfulfilling relationships or we are struggling to experience closeness in our relationships, self-compassion is an important tool for caring for ourselves and supporting our mental health.</p>

<p>Without self-compassion we can reinforce limiting beliefs that we are unlovable and incapable of experiencing intimacy and closeness in relationships.</p>

<p>When we experience conflict or challenges in our relationships it causes our nervous systems to react, due to an evolutionary fear of rejection, abandonment and isolation.</p>
