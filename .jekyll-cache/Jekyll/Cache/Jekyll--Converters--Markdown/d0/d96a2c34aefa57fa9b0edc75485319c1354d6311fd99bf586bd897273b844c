<p>When we imagine an aspect of a future situation that we feel we canâ€™t cope with, our mind tries to solve the problem by thinking about it. This can cause a â€˜Thought Loopâ€™ that is caused by our thoughts triggering more feelings of stress and anxiety, that in turn fuel more thoughts and stronger emotions.</p>

<p>This process of overthinking in relation to a real or imagined future scenario that we perceive as threatening, is called â€˜ Ruminationâ€™.</p>

<p>The word comes from the word â€˜ruminateâ€™ which is the continued chewing motion that animals use to digest their food. We can think of rumination as the process of â€˜ chewing on our thoughtsâ€™.Â </p>

<p>Research has shown that people who ruminate more are more likely to struggle with anxiety and depression. This makes sense, as the more our minds focus on problems, the more we will feel stuck and unable to change them.Â </p>
