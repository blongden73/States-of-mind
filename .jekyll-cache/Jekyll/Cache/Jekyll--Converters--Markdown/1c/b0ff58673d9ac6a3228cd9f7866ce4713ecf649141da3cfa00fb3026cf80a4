<p>Potential</p>

<p>What do young people need to live 
their potential?</p>

<p>Our world needs the thinkers, 
do-ers and leaders of tomorrow 
to feel like theyâ€™ve got this.</p>

<p>But in a rapidly changing world, 
being young and transitioning into 
adult life is more challenging than 
ever. We believe thereâ€™s a better 
way of supporting young peopleâ€™s 
wellbeing, and weâ€™ll only find it by 
fully engaging them in the process 
of change.</p>
