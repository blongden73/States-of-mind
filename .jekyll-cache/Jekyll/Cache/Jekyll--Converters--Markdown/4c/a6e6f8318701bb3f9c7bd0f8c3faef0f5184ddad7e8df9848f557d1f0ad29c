I"¦<p>At States of Mind, we view mental health concerns in the wider context of young peopleâ€™s lives â€“ from community to school environment â€“ and work with them to identify and address the causes of distress. Breaking the Silence is our ongoing youth-led research project exploring young peopleâ€™s views on how the UK education system is having an impact on their mental health, identity and personal development.</p>
