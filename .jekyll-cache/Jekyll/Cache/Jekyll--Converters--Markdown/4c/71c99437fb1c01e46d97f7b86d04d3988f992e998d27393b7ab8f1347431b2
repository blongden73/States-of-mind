I"Ê<p>Anxiety becomes a problem in our lives when we begin to notice a reduced ability to cope with situations in our everyday life.</p>

<p>If we have experienced a situation in the past that we have not processed, it can cause us to feel like we canâ€™t manage or cope in the present.</p>

<p>This is because our threat detector, or â€˜smoke alarmâ€™ becomes overactive and responds more sensitively to things we may not normally perceive as threatening.</p>
