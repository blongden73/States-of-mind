<p><strong>The Johari Window is a visual representation of aspects of the self that are known or unknown to ourselves and others.</strong></p>

<p>The open area represents everything we know about ourselves. This is what people who know us know about us and what we are consciously aware of too.</p>

<p>The hidden area relates to all of the parts of ourselves that we do not share with others. This information that we keep private may relate to our fears and insecurities swell as your hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>The blind spot relates to our potential for personal growth through our close and trusted relationships. Our friends and family can provide us with feedback and honesty that can help us to see ourselves more clearly. This can relate to both our positive attributes and areas for growth.</p>

<p>The unknown relates to information about ourselves that is unconscious to both ourselves and others. This relates to parts of ourselves we still have yet to discover through new experiences.</p>
