I"ý<p>Subpersonalities cause difficulties when you identify with one part of yourself and believe it to be all of you.</p>

<p>For example, if you are identified with the â€˜High achieverâ€™ part of yourself, it may help you to get good grades and maintain a motivation for developing your knowledge and feel respected for your academic ability. However, if this part of you evolved from wanting love and respect from others, you may become over identified with this part of yourself and feel very distressed by setbacks or punish yourself for not meeting the expectations of others.</p>

<p>Your sub personalities all emerge from an unmet need. By identifying these needs you can develop more self awareness and understanding of where this part of you came from.</p>
