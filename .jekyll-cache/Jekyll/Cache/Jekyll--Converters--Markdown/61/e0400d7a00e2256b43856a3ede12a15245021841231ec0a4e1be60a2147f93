<p>Self compassion involves bringing awareness to our discomfort and distress and understanding that our pain and suffering is a normal part of being human.</p>

<p>By bringing an attitude of care and acceptance towards ourselves, we can focus our energy away from our worries and concerns, towards a dedicated attempt to reassure and support ourselves.</p>

<p>By turning towards our feelings, instead of resisting them, we can begin to self soothe and calm our anxiety.</p>
