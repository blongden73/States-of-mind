I"T<p>When you experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected in your body as tension and discomfort.</p>

<p>One of the ways you manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into your mind. Often you don’t realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to bring awareness to yourself in the present moment and reconnect with your body as a way to calm yourself and rebalance your mood.</p>

<p>Dance movement psychotherapy is effective because it allows you to use our body to influence your mood and release trapped and difficult emotions. </p>
