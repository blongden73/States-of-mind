I"»<p>A few months ago I asked the groups of 17 year olds I was working with what they thought the world would be like if people were more self aware. There were common themes that emerged. People would be kinder to each other, there would be less conflict, people would be more forgiving. Some suggested there would be less cruelty in the world, less war, a healthier planet and integration between communities with ideological differences.</p>
