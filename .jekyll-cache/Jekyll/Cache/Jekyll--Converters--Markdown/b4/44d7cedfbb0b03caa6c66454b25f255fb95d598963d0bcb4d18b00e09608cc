I"<p>Your relationship with your caregiver/s provides you with your first experiences of what relationships are like. Attunement is a shared relational experience where we sense that we are witnessed and experienced clearly by others.</p>

<p>If your caregiver/s was present and aware of  your emotional needs and reflected back to you a positive sense of self, you will carry a sense of self worth and self-esteem into your adult relationships and will feel able to communicate openly and honesty about your emotional life.</p>
