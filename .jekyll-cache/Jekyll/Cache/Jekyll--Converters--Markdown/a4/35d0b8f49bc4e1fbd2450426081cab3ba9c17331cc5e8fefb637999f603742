I"0<p>Mentalising is a skill that we all use in our everyday lives.</p>

<p>The term is used to describe our capacity to understand our own mental state and that of other people and how this affects our behaviour.</p>

<p>Mentalising allows us to think consciously about what we are thinking and feeling, aswell as being curious about what may be going on in other people’s minds.</p>

<p>Mentalising allows us to switch from concrete thought ‘ She is behaving like that because’ to a wondering stance ‘ I wonder why she may be behaving like that’.</p>
