I"_<p><strong>Authenticity</strong></p>

<p>This means being aware of your own feelings, as far as possible, without presenting an outward facade of one attitude, while actually holding another attitude at a deeper or unconscious level.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance</strong></p>

<p>This is the sense that we are seen as a person of unconditional self worth and of value, no matter what our condition, behaviour or feelings may be.</p>

<p>It is only when others experience us as we experience ourselves that we can feel free to explore all of the different aspects of our inner and often buried experience.</p>
