I"<p>In healthy relationships, each person feels seen and understood for their true nature and is able to act and communicate from this place. This way of being with each other is what the Psychologist Bowlby called a secure base. How can you provide and recognise a secure base in relationships?Â </p>

<p>Problems are addressed as they arise in relationships, without the person harbouring resentment or communicating in unclear ways about the nature of the problem.Â </p>

<p>When the person is upset and emotionally struggling, the partner makes space to understand and listen to them, without minimising or punishing you for experiencing the emotions.Â Â </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities for growth, not personal attacks or opportunities to play a blame game. People who are secure in their relationships, do not take criticism as a reason to blame the other, but are open to listening to the issue and adapting their behaviour to better meet the needs of their partner.Â </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities to create growth and understanding in the relationship. By learning about what is causing the problems, the partner is better able to understand the needs of the other person and what they need to feel safe and secure, instead of misunderstood and anxious.Â Â </p>
