I"î<p>We can use our mind to come up with ideas and to create insights that can help us to make decisions more easily. How do we enable this part of the mind to work?Â </p>

<p>Often, this is the part of the mind that we are not encouraged to use as much, so it can take a bit of practice to remind ourselves of what it feels like to use this part of the mind. This part of the mind is much softer and it enjoys working in ways that are more imaginative, like storytelling.Â </p>

<p>Whenever somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps us to imagine future possibilities and helps us to access parts of our experience we have not yet seen. When we close our eyes and allow ourselves to imagine something, it helps us to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening.Â </p>

<p>When we get stuck with a decision, itâ€™s because we feel like we donâ€™t know what the outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people we are having the problem with, we can visualise other aspects that we canâ€™t access when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one belief or potential situation.Â </p>
