<p>Depression is an experience that is manifests in our mental, emotional and physical experience. It is characterised by an intense preoccupation with negative thinking about our past, current and future self. These ways of thinking are accompanied by an emotional experience of meaninglessness and ‘apathy’, which is the loss of interest or pleasure in life. People experiencing depression also experience changes to their physical state, such as increased tiredness and fatigue and difficulty concentrating. </p>
