<p>When we imagine an aspect of a future situation that we feel we can’t cope with, our mind tries to solve the problem by thinking about it. This can cause a ‘Thought Loop’ that is caused by our thoughts triggering more feelings of stress and anxiety, that in turn fuel more thoughts and stronger emotions.</p>

<p>This process of overthinking in relation to a real or imagined future scenario that we perceive as threatening, is called ‘ Rumination’.</p>

<p>The word comes from the word ‘ruminate’ which is the continued chewing motion that animals use to digest their food. We can think of rumination as the process of ‘ chewing on our thoughts’. </p>

<p>Research has shown that people who ruminate more are more likely to struggle with anxiety and depression.</p>
