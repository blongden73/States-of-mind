I"Ñ<p>**A letter to your past self. **</p>

<p>When we write to ourselves in the third person as if we were speaking to a friend, it allows us to zoom out and reflect on our experience with the same empathy and compassion we feel for others. Take this opportunity, if you feel you would like to, to try writing a letter to yourself. Reflect on the last 3 years of your life and think about the parts of your experience that you value and acknowledge as meaningful and significant. This reflection will allow you to bring awareness to the parts of yourself that you are grateful for and tune in more easily to the meaning in your life.</p>

<p>When you reflect on the last 3 years of your life, what would you like to say to your past self?</p>

<p>What experiences have you had that meant a lot to you and what do you want to say to your past self in relation to them?</p>

<p>What would you like your past self to know, based on what you have learned from the last 3 years?</p>
