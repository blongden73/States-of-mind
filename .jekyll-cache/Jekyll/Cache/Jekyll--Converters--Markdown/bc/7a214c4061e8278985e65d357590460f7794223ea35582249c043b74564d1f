<p>Our mission is to make psychological theory and practice more accessible for young people, so that they can benefit from the rich insights that psychology can bring to our understanding of ourselves and others.<strong>We teach young people about psychosocial and trauma informed theories of mental health</strong> <strong>Our series of seminars explores how our personal histories of life shape our mind, personality and self-perception, without using diagnostic labels to describe distress.</strong><a href="/">Book programme</a></p>

<h1 id="exploration">Exploration</h1>

<p>We create spaces that help young people explore the underlying causes of emotional distress. We are curious about what lies behind the surface of problems and by exploring the complexity of issues, we work with young people to find solutions that can really work.<strong>Our research underpins our work and we use it to provide clarity, direction and purpose.
By combining research and systems theory, we have developed an approach that is built from a meaningful search for better ways of helping people.</strong> <strong>We embrace complexity and dedicate our work to revealing whatâ€™s really contributing to problems, so that we can create meaningful and sustainable solutions.</strong></p>

<h1 id="social-impact">Social impact</h1>

<p>In order to prevent psychological distress from reaching a crisis point, systems must evolve to listen more closely to the voices and needs of young people at an earlier stage.<strong>By embedding our model within education, we aim to develop more effective methods for the education system to support young peopleâ€™s mental health, throughout their academic life and beyond.</strong> <strong>We combine education with social action for meaningful and sustainable change. Using a social enterprise model, our programme supports young people to lead their own projects and initiatives, so they can take their learning and insights forward to a wider audience.</strong></p>
