I"/<p>Compassion is the foundation for empathy, love and compromise in relationships.</p>

<p>Compassion is an attitude and belief in equality and each persons right to be valued and understood.</p>

<p>When we do not judge or criticise the behaviour of another person but take time to understand and work through problems together, we show the other person that we do not see problems in the relationship as Indications of their worth. Instead, we see working through problems  as an opportunity for growth that can provide deeper levels of understanding and connection.</p>

<p>By respecting another person as having the same needs for love, connection and understanding as ourselves, we can overcome the judgement and limiting beliefs about others that can cause distance and misunderstanding in relationships.</p>
