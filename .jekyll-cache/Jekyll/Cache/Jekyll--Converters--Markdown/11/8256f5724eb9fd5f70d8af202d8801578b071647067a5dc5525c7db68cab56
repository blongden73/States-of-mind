I"<p>A Psychologist called Donald Winnicott coined this term to refer to the fact that no parent can meet your needs all of the time and that no parenting style can be completely perfect.</p>

<p>Your parents are individuals with their own potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from their childhoods.</p>

<p>For example, your parents may have struggled expressing their emotions as a child and feel uncomfortable discussing emotions with you. These patterns are passed down through families and can create patterns in how we learn to relate emotionally with others.</p>
