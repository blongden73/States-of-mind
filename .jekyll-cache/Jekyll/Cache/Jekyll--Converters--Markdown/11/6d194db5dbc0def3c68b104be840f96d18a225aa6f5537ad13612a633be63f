I"<p>In healthy relationships, each person feels seen and understood for their true nature and is able to act and communicate from this place.</p>

<p>Problems are addressed as they arise in relationships, without the person harbouring resentment or communicating in unclear ways about the nature of the problem. </p>

<p>When the person is upset and emotionally struggling, the partner makes space to understand and listen to them, without minimising or punishing you for experiencing the emotions.  </p>

<p>Problems are seen as opportunities for growth, not personal attacks or opportunities to play a blame game. People who are secure in their relationships, do not take criticism as a reason to blame the other, but are open to listening to the feedback about how they make others feel.</p>
