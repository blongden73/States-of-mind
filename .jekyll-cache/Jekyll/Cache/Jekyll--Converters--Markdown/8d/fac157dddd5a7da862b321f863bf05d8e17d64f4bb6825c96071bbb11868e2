I"<p>Under the many layers of your identity and your personality is your true self, this part of you never changes but exists throughout your life as your innermost being. This part of yourself exists independently of your thoughts, feelings and roles that you play in the world.</p>

<p>When you are connected with your authentic self, you are able to live freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, you accept your qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who you most essentially are.</p>
