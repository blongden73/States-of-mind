I"><p>Melanie Klein was a psychologist who focuses on the relationships between parents and children.</p>

<p>She coined the term ‘splitting’ to describe a psychological defence that young children develop to manage ambivalent feelings towards their parents.</p>

<p>As young children we manage difficult feelings in relationships by engaging in a process called ‘splitting’. This process splits our perception of our parents into either a ‘good parent’ or a ‘bad parent’.</p>

<p>This process causes feelings of either idealisation in relationships or feelings of resentment and an inability to see the other persons good qualities.</p>

<p>Healthy relationships require that we are aware of this tendency and are able to love another person while experiencing both their positive and more difficult behaviours.</p>
