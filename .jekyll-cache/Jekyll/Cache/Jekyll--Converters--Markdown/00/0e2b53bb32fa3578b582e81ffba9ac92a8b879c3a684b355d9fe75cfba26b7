I"ö<p>Anxiety is also triggered as a response to a threat to our attachment needs for safety and connection.<br />
Attachment needs are needs for love, connection and acceptance. When we do not feel secure in our relationships our in our environments, anxiety is a natural alarm system that exists as a coping mechanism to tell us something is wrong.<br />
Anxiety can cause us to avoid relationships and social situations or to change our behaviour while around others out of fear of being rejected.</p>
