<p>Focus on your breathing and allow your emotions to become calm.</p>

<p>The next step is to choose an object or a point on which to focus your attention. Choose something that you find interesting or pleasurable to observe.</p>

<p>When you have chosen your object or point, allow your feelings to become still until you feel calm and centred. Placing your attention on the object or point, begin to notice your mind and what it wants to do. Does it make judgments about what you are doing? Does it want to look at something else?</p>

<p>Keep focusing on the object and begin to notice as many different qualities of the object as possible. Notice how easy or difficult it is to maintain your attention on one point. Remember to breathe and to keep your feelings calm but also allow yourself to notice how your feelings affect your mind and your ability to concentrate. Stay with the object for another moment, noticing what types of thoughts you have and what happens when you focus your attention in one place.</p>

<p>This is the tendency of the mind to get distracted. Make notes and reflections on what types of thoughts you had and what the experience was like for you.</p>
