  <li>Be attentive. Be interested. Be alert and not distracted. Create a positive atmosphere through nonverbal behaviour.</li>
  <li>Be a sounding board â€“ allow the speaker to bounce ideas and feelings off you while assuming a nonjudgmental, non-critical manner.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t ask a lot of questions. They can give the impression you are â€œgrillingâ€ the speaker.</li>
  <li>Act like a mirror â€“ reflect back what you think the speaker is saying and feeling.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t discount the speakerâ€™s feelings by using stock phrases like â€œItâ€™s not that bad,â€ or â€œYouâ€™ll feel better tomorrow.â€</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t let the speaker â€œhookâ€ you. This can happen if you get angry or upset, allow yourself to get involved in an argument, or pass judgment on the other person.</li>
  <li>Indicate you are listening by:
â€¢ Providing brief, acknowledging responses, e.g., â€œUh-huh,â€ â€œI see.â€
â€¢ Giving nonverbal acknowledgements, e.g., head nodding, facial expressions matching the speaker, open and relaxed body expression, eye contact.
â€¢ Invitations to say more, e.g., â€œTell me about it,â€ â€œIâ€™d like to hear about that.â€</li>

â€¢ Donâ€™t interrogate.
