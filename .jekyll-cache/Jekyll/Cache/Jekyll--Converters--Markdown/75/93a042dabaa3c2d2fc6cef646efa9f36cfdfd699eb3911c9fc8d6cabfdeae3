I"¾<p>A subpersonality is a response pattern that causes us to act, feel and think in distinct ways.</p>

<p>When people fail to respond empathetically to your true personality, or you feel uncomfortable being yourself, you learn to hide your authentic nature and adapt to how you think you should be.</p>

<p>For example, if you found that you got love and attention from your parents when you were helpful and didnâ€™t express your concerns, you may develop a â€˜people-pleaserâ€™ part of yourself.</p>

<p>A psychotherapist called Winnicott also called this process of adapting, the development of the False Self. It has also been referred to as the Survival Personality or â€˜Character Armourâ€™.</p>
