I"ç<p>Our relationship with our family provides us with our first experiences of what relationships are like.</p>

<p>The way that our parent/s responded to our needs for authenticity and connection in childhood shapes our understanding of whether we can trust others to meet these needs .</p>

<p>If our family was present and attuned to what we needed and reflected back to us a positive sense of self, we will carry a sense of self worth and self-esteem into our adult relationships and will feel able to communicate openly and honesty about our emotional life.</p>

<p>This process of reflecting back our authentic self is called ‚Äòattunement‚Äô.</p>
