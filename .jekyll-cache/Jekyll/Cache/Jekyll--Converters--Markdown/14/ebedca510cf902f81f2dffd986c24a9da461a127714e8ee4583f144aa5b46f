I"H<p>When fighting or running seems impossible or because the threat seems too powerful, our brain triggers a ‘Freeze Response’ that can feel very difficult to break out of.</p>

<p>For example, if you have an upcoming test and you feel overwhelmed, you may feel paralysed and ‘frozen’ and unable to cope.</p>

<p>You may feel feelings of numbness, detachment and dissociation which is caused by your brain separating you from the unpleasantness and strength of your emotions.</p>

<p>You may also feel overwhelmed, a sense of stiffness or a feeling of holding your breath.</p>
