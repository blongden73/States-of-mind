I"Ì<p>Breathing is a tool that we can use to connect us with our bodies and restore balance to the underlying biological cause of stress, tension and emotional distress.</p>

<p>When we breathe deeply, our diaphragm presses against the main nerve in our nervous system called the vagus nerve. This nerve is responsible for sending impulses to the brain that tells our mind it can relax.</p>

<p>When the vagus nerve is not activated enough, our brain can become overstimulated, causing mental tension, anxiety and rumination.Â </p>

<p>The vagus nerve is the part of our body that is responsible for a large part of the mind-body connection.</p>

<p>We notice the effect of the vagus nerve when we do things that relieve physical tension and our minds become more relaxed and focused.</p>

<p>The vagus nerve sends messages between our internal body parts and our brain, sending messages back and forth that affect the functioning of our physical body and mental states.</p>
