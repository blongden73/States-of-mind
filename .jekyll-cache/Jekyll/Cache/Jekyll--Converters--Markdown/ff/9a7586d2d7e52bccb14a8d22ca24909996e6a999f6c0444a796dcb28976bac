I"i<p>Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing our awareness to the present moment consciously and non-judgementally. 
Often, our thoughts become preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on our past or overanalysing our personal experiences. 
Through mindfulness, we can ‘step back’ and become attuned to our present moment experience.</p>
