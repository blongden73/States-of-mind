<p>Mental health concerns are
often spoken about as isolated
and individual problems. But
we believe they are inseparable
from the social contexts in
which we grow. With levels of
distress rising, itâ€™s clear we
need to rethink how our society
supports emotional and mental
wellbeing.</p>

<h1 id="space--exploration"><img src="/uploads/space_icon.svg" />Space &amp; exploration</h1>

<p>Growing up, we often have little
space to openly explore how our
social world and experiences of
life impact our sense of who we
are. We work in schools and
communities, creating spaces
for those experiences to be
heard. Exploring issues from
a psychological perspective,
we aim to help young people
understand their mental health
in new ways and overcome the
idea that they are flawed or
different for struggling with
lifeâ€™s challenges.</p>

<h1 id="collaboration-and-design"><img src="/uploads/change_icon.svg" />Collaboration and Design</h1>

<p>We are working with young people and psychologists to understand approaches to mental health that arenâ€™t working for young people and to design, together, new methods that do. Through talks, self exploration and collaborative, project-led learning, we work to create a world where our emotional wellbeing is prioritised and supported. One that enables us to feel valued and fulfilled in our everyday lives.</p>
