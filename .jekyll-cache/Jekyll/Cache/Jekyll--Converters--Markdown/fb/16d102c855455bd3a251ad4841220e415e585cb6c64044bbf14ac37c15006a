<p>Mental health concerns are 
often spoken about as isolated 
and individual problems. But 
we believe they are inseparable 
from the social contexts in 
which we grow. With levels of 
distress rising, it’s clear we 
need to rethink how our society 
supports emotional and mental 
wellbeing.</p>

<p>Growing up, we often have little 
space to openly explore how our 
social world and experiences of 
life impact our sense of who we 
are. We work in schools and 
communities, creating spaces 
for those experiences to be 
heard. Exploring issues from 
a psychological perspective, 
we aim to help young people 
understand their mental health 
in new ways and overcome the 
idea that they are flawed or 
different for struggling with 
life’s challenges.</p>

<p>We believe in hope and 
opportunity amidst chaos 
and uncertainty. Our mission 
is bring hope to the lives 
of young people in our 
society and create a future 
that values the beauty and 
complexity of the human 
experience.</p>
