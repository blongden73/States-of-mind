**
Free drawings display, with richness and often precision, the energies and feelings that motivate our lives, tendencies that no words can describe.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>take several coloured pens and some pieces of paper. Before beginning to draw. Allow yourself a few moments of relaxed, calm awareness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now let your hand draw, and watch with mild curiosity what is taking shape on the paper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow your hand to draw absolutely anything it wants, abstract or concrete. Let the quality of what comes up be whatever it wants to be, even if it doesn’t coincide with your present idea of yourself. And as you draw let your hand movements be whatever they wish to be, jerky or flowing, quick or slow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you feel you have finished, study your drawing. Is it really finished or does it lack a final touch? If so, complete it in any way you like.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Instead of judging it in an intellectual way, we should listen to the drawing’s story. This drawing may represent something new and different to what our surface mind feels like. We seek to resonate with it and intuitively capture the message it gives us about ourselves.</p>

<p>After a while, we turn the drawing over and write what comes to mind.</p>

<p>Even if our drawings remain meaningless, we will have still partially satisfied a vital need - the need for expression. Many people find a new, childlike delight in playing with pencils or pens, in bypassing the control of the intellect and experiencing the pure fun of creativity.</p>
