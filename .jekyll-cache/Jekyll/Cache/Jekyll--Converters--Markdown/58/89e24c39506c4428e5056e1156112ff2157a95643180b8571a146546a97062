<p>Our vision is for a world where mental health support is embedded within systems, not separate from them. Where times of suffering don’t disconnect us, but help us learn about ourselves and eachother,  acknowledge our needs, and make sense of our problems together.</p>

<p>We provide young people with different ways of understanding their emotional world through a programme that fosters self awareness, connection, and hope.</p>

<p>Our seminars draw on Psychosynthesis theory and a range of other psychological models that explore the human experience.</p>

<h1 id="social-action">Social action</h1>

<p>Ideas raised to action can change the world. Working with and listening to young people, we combine insights with social action so that the problems we find can be transformed into meaningful change.</p>

<p>Our programme’s project-based learning model enables young people to identify key issues affecting their wellbeing, and then design and lead a social impact initiative as a solution.</p>
