I"<p>Even if we know our relationships are unfitlfilling and not meeting our needs, it can feel  difficult to move forward and take the initiative to end the relationship. The feelings of pain and detachment are extremely strong feelings that motivate us to maintain the relationship at all costs. It is actually painful emotions that can keep us in unhealthy relationships, not just the positive ones.</p>

<p>Once our painful feelings of abandonment and low self esteem are activated, we become focused on reconnecting with the person and often trick ourselves into believing that each time we reconnect, we will get our needs met the next time, causing repeating cycles of rupture, repair and further rupture when we realise that the problems still exist but we feel powerless to change them.</p>

<p>This causes us to feel even more hopeless and even less able to solve problems in our relationships and get our needs met. This belief can cause us to develop the belief that no relationship will meet our needs because we internalise the experience and blame ourselves for the feelings of isolation and neglect.</p>

<p>The fear of being alone and unloved causes us to maintain relationships that are only partially able to meet our needs and we end up feeling unfulfilled and distressed. </p>
