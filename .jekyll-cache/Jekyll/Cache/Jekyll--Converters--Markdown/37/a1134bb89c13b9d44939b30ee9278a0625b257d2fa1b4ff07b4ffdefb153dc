<p>When you create from the rational mind, things seem very factual and concrete. This is really helpful for answering questions and providing information for other people to understand. You can use your rational mind to convey your thoughts in a way that is simple and clear.</p>

<p>The rational mind is also really helpful for communicating things you have already learned and want to tell to others. This is why people often get into arguments when they use their rational mind because they are communicating different things that they understand but not considering other possibilities with their imagination.Â </p>
