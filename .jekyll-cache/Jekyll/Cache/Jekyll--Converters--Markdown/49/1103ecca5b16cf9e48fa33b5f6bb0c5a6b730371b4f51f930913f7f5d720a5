<p>We like to think of ourselves as one consistent personality or person but in reality, we are composed of many different aspects and parts, that all serve an important role in our lives. 
Self awareness allows us to recognise that our identity is not fixed but is an ever-changing reflection of our experiences, values and relationships. Self awareness allows us to explore the emotional connection or resistance we have to them.</p>

<p>By exploring the different aspects of our personal identity we can gain a deeper understanding of what makes us unique and what connects us most fundamentally with others.</p>

<p>We can then develop insights into the causes of our problems and our potential for growth, and recover our gifts and qualities that we are blind to.  </p>
