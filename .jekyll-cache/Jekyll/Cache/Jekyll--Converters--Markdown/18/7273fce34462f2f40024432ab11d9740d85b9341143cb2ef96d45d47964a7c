I"^<p>Donâ€™t chose what you think you should do, chose something that you personally enjoy and want to do. Imagine a positive life that you want to have, what sorts of activities and things are you doing? The aim is to allow yourself to feel joy, contentment and other positive and reassuring feelings through the activities in your everyday life.</p>
