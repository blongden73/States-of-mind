I"‡<p>Our early relationship with our parents are one of the biggest influences on how we view and act in our relationships,</p>

<p>It is common to internalise beliefs that we developed in our early childhood relationships. These may be positive beliefs such as trusting we can depend on others for support or limiting beliefs such as feeling that we need to abandon our own needs to remain in a positive relationship with others.</p>

<p>By understanding the different relationship styles and dynamics that we can develop we can become aware of how and why we struggle in relationships and learn how to change any behaviours that hold us back.</p>
