I"5<p><strong>Limiting beliefs and supportive beliefs</strong></p>

<p>Some beliefs are attached to positive emotions and some beliefs have uncomfortable emotions attached to them. When a belief has an uncomfortable emotion attached to it, we call it a limiting belief. When a belief has a positive emotion attached to it we call it a supportive belief.</p>

<p>Why donâ€™t you explore some of your supportive beliefs and see how these supportive beliefs have helped you in the past?</p>

<p>Think of a situation where you had a belief that was connected with a positive emotion. What happened in this situation where you brought your supportive belief to a task, situation or personal relationship. Notice how the belief made you act and notice how the belief had an effect on the way that you approached what you did.</p>
