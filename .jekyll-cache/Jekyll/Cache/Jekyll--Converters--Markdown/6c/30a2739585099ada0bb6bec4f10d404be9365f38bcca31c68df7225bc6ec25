I"U<p>People who are experiencing depression often hold an underlying belief that they are not loveable, are flawed and not worthy of love &amp; acceptance.  </p>

<p>Why is unconditional positive regard important when people are experiencing depression? </p>

<p>By showing unconditional positive regard it allows others to open up about negative beliefs and parts of themselves they feel ashamed of. </p>

<p>Unconditional positive regard removes any judgement or evaluation of others and allows others to feel that they are able to be accepted for who they are, without needing to change.</p>
