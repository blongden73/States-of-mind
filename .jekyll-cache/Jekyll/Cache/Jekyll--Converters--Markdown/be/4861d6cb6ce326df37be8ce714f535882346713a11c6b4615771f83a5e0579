I"Ù<p>Whenever somebody comes up with an idea, they have an image of the idea that comes along with the thought of it. This is the visual part of the mind that helps you to imagine future possibilities. When you close our eyes and allow yourself to imagine something, it helps you to visualise all of the outcomes of that reality happening.Â </p>

<p>When you get stuck with a decision, itâ€™s because you feel like you donâ€™t know what the outcome will be, so by visualising the different situations, problems or people you are having the problem with, you can also visualise other aspects that you canâ€™t access when we are stuck in the thinking, judging mind that likes to get stuck on one belief or potential situation.Â </p>
