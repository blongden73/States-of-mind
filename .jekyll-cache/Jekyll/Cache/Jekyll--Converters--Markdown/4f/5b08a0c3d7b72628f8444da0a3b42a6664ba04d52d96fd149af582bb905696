I"Ì<p>Anxiety becomes a problem if you begin to notice a reduced ability to cope with situations in your everyday life.</p>

<p>If you have experienced a situation in the past that you have not processed, it can cause you to feel like you canâ€™t manage or cope with present challenges.</p>

<p>This is because your threat detector, or â€˜smoke alarmâ€™ becomes overactive and responds more sensitively to things you may not normally perceive as threatening.</p>
