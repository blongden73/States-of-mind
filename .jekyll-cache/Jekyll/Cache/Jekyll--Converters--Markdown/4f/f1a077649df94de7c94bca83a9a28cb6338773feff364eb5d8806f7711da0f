I"É<p>â€œI never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train.â€ Oscar Wilde was right. A diary recalls oneâ€™s sensation from the past, present, and future, so it follows that it would always be a sensational read. Wilde humours his audience by hinting that his life was always more interesting than any character from a novel, and considering his biography and fantastic work of art, he was probably right.</p>
