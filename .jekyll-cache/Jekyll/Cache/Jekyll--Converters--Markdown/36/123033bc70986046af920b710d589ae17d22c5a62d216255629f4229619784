I"<p>Neuroscientists have discovered that the brain is able to continue reshaping itself through our adolescence and adult life. This means that early emotional and behavioural patterns can change with new experiences that we have throughout our lives.</p>

<p>Often, we will repeat similar patterns in our relationships due to the way our early childhood experiences shape our perception of the present day, yet our relationships in adult life can also reshape our perception of what relationships can be like.</p>

<p>The brains ability to reshape itself has significant positive implications for our understanding of how people can heal difficult relationship patterns, learning new skills and develop new beliefs about their ability to experience intimacy and connection with others.</p>
