I"Ö<p>Neuroscientists have identified a distinct neural network in the brain that is activated when we ruminate called the â€˜Default Mode Networkâ€™ .</p>

<p>When the â€˜Default Modeâ€™ Network is active, it may look like nothing is happening from the outside but actually inside our minds, we will be daydreaming, reflecting or thinking about our lives.</p>

<p>The default mode is active when we are worrying or preoccupied with thoughts about the past and future.</p>
