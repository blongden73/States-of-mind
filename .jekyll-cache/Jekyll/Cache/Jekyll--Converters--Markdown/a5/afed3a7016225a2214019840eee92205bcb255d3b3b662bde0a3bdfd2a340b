I"h<p>“Gratitude has been conceptualized as an emotion, a virtue, a moral sentiment, a motive, a coping response, a skill, and an attitude. It is all of these and more,”</p>

<p>(Emmons &amp; Crumpler, 2000)</p>

<p>**What is gratitude? **</p>

<p>Gratitude is the ability to pay attention to the aspects of our lives and the people around us, that bring us joy, happiness and a sense of humility. When we become distracted and preoccupied with life’s many demands it’s easy to forget to take time to appreciate all those things in our environment that nurture us and bring us a sense of wellbeing.</p>

<p>Gratitude is closely connected to our ability to pay attention and consciously reflect on the things we have that are important to us. These may be small moments we have enjoyed that we are grateful to have experienced, belongings that remind us of important times in our lives or the people in our life who make us feel supported and cared for.</p>

<p>When we bring attention to these things, it allows us to move from a mindset of scarcity and lack, to a mindset of appreciation for all that we have.</p>

<p>**Healing our Scarcity Mindset **</p>

<p>When we are in a scarcity mindset and focus on all the things we don’t have that others do, we feel fear and inadequacy and often become unable to notice and recognise the value and meaning that already exists in our lives. When we bring an attitude of appreciation, it allows us to see those parts of our lives we have neglected and not paid attention to in our busyness.  It helps us to stop comparing ourselves to others and can help us to restore our self-esteem.</p>
