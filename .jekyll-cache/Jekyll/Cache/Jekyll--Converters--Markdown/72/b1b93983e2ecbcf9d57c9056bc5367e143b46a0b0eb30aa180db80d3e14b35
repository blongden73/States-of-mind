<p>**What is post-traumatic growth? **</p>

<p>Post-traumatic growth is personal growth that occurs after experiencing a challenging, painful or traumatic experience. The growth occurs because we identify part of ourselves that we did not recognise or acknowledge about ourselves, that served us and enabled us to adapt to and survive difficult experiences.</p>

<p>The inner resources that we draw upon when encountering challenging circumstances, can become integrated into our everyday lives and strengthen our belief that we are able to respond to adversity. We develop confidence that we will find methods to adapt and survive in the future. Anxiety is caused by feeling that we will be unable to manage and survive challenging situations or circumstances that we encounter, whereas post-traumatic growth happens as a consequence of facing, surviving and learning from the circumstances that we thought would threaten our inner resources and ability to function in the world.</p>

<p><strong>What does research show us about post-traumatic growth?</strong></p>

<p>Research on post - traumatic growth also shows that people who experience traumatic situations of various kinds display greater empathy, compassion and connection with others as a result of their experience. The experience of adversity serves as a reminder that we are connected to others in our vulnerability and able to experience the same set - backs, challenges and emotional difficulties as those people who we once experienced as different from us. We are able to become more attuned to the feelings and needs of other people and therefore people who have experienced great adversity are often able to foster more deep and fulfilling relationships than they had before the traumatic experience occurred.</p>

<p>Adversity provides obstacles and setbacks that cause us to question our perception of our future potential. By overcoming these obstacles that are encountered in times of adversity, we integrate the learning into our vision of the future and develop hope in our ability to overcome future challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Reflecting on examples of post-traumatic growth in your life</strong></p>

<p>Think about a time in your life when you encountered a set back, challenge or obstacle that was painful and unexpected.</p>

<p>Reflect on any anxiety you had at the time about your ability to manage and overcome the challenge or situation.</p>

<p>Makes notes about the types of thoughts you had about what might happen and what the outcome might be.</p>

<p>Now, reflect on the outcome of the situation and what part of you, or qualities about yourself you discovered as a result of surviving this challenging time. What inner resources did you find within yourself to overcome the challenge and make it through?</p>
