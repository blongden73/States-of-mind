<p>Our vision is for a world where it’s natural to talk about and care for our emotional and mental wellbeing. Where times of suffering don’t disconnect us, but help us align with who we are, acknowledge our needs, and make sense of our lives, together.</p>

<p>We educate young people about mental health through a programme that fosters self awareness, connection, and hope. Our work is based on therapeutic approaches, which offer a chance to understand yourself, others, and explore how you can fully land in your potential, with integrity.</p>

<h1 id="social-action">Social action</h1>

<p>Ideas raised to action can change the world. Working with and listening to young people, we combine insights with social action so that the problems we find can be transformed into meaningful change.</p>

<p>Our programme’s project-based learning model enables young people to identify key issues affecting their wellbeing, and then design and lead a social impact initiative as a solution.</p>
