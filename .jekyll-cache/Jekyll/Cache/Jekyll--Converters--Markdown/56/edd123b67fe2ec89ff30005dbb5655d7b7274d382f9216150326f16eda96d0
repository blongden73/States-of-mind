<p>Growing numbers of young people in the UK are seeking help for their mental health, but many arenâ€™t getting the support they want or need. With the NHS unable to meet the rising demand, we believe itâ€™s time for a new approach, one that is co-created with young people outside of clinical settings.</p>

<p>By supporting young people to develop self-knowledge, compassion and curiosity towards their inner life, we can help them find meaning in suffering. We run trauma-informed mental health education programmes in schools, providing young people with an understanding of mental health that functions without the use of diagnostic labels.</p>

<p>If young people are to thrive and live their potential, we need to make sure our societyâ€™s approach to mental health is working. We work alongside young people and psychologists to create social impact and research projects that enable young peopleâ€™s experiences, views and ideas to be a driving force for change.</p>
