<p>Our research enables young peopleâ€™s voices to inform the way emotional and mental wellbeing is supported in society. We work with young people to find whatâ€™s causing the problems and what they believe will work better.</p>

<p>We design our research projects to enable young people to shape the future and inspire new ways of thinking.</p>
