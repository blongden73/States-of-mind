I"G<p>The vagus nerve is the part of our body that is responsible for a large part of the mind-body connection.</p>

<p>The vagus nerve sends messages between our internal body parts and our brain, sending messages back and forth that affect the functioning of our physical body and mental states.</p>

<p>When the vagus nerve is not activated enough, our brain can become overstimulated, causing mental tension, anxiety and rumination.Â </p>

<p>We notice the effect of the vagus nerve when we do things that relieve physical tension and our minds become more relaxed and focused.</p>
