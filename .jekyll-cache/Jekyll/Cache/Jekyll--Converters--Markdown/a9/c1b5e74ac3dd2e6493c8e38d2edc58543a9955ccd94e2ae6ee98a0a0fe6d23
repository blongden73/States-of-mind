I"Š<p>Even if you know your relationships are unfitlfilling and not meeting our needs, it can feelÂ  difficult to move forward and take the initiative to end the relationship.</p>

<p>The feelings of pain and detachment are extremely strong feelings that motivate you to maintain the relationship at all costs.</p>

<p>It is actually painful emotions that can keep you in unhealthy relationships, not just the positive ones.</p>

<p>Once our painful feelings of abandonment and low self esteem are activated, you become focused on reconnecting with the person and often trick ourselves into believing that each time you reconnect, you will get our needs met the next time, causing repeating cycles of rupture, repair and further rupture when you realise that the problems still exist but you feel powerless to change them.</p>

<p>This causes you to feel even more hopeless and even less able to solve problems in your relationships and get your needs met.</p>

<p>This belief can cause you to develop the perception that no relationship will meet your needs because you internalise the experience and blame yourself for the feelings of isolation and neglect.</p>
