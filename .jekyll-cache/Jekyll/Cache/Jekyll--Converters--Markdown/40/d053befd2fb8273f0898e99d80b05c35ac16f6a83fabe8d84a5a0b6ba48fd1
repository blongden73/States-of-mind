I"[<p>Empathic listening is a type of listening that involves tuning into the emotional message that a person is communicating. 
Empathic listening helps people to understand their emotions better, builds trust and helps both the speaker and listener to develop emotional intelligence.</p>

<p>Bifocal vision is a way to provide feedback about another personâ€™s non-verbal communication and listen to the deeper message they are communicating.</p>

<p>For example, if somebody is telling us that they have had a good week but their tone of voice is low, bifocal vision allows us to pick up on this mis-match between what the person is saying and the emotional message they are giving to us. 
By feeding back both the verbal message and the emotional message that we are hearing from the speaker, we allow them to feel seen and understood on a deeper level.</p>
