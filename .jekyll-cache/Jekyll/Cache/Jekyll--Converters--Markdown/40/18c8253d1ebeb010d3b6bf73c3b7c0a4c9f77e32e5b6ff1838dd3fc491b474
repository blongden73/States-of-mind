</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Felt constantly threatened (repeated job loss, poverty, homelessness, out of sync with mainstream &amp; workplace values, relationship failure, social pariah):Â low mood, worry, mental and physical activation, weird appetite and sleep
2.  Felt out of options (low physical, material and social resources; tired all the time, brain not functioning):Â hopelessness, sadness, despair, indecision
3.  Gas pedal/sympathetic (constant pressure to do something to fix it):Â worry, activation, insomnia, eating for energy
4.  Brake/parasympathetic (no clue how to fix it, where to turn or if it would ever get better):Â Low energy, low mood, low appetite and low interest in life; digestive troubles, stomach cramps, poor thinking and concentration; leaden limbs, sleeping a lot
5.  Life indefinitely stalled by Brake (wasting myÂ life, leaving a legacy of suffering and pain, letting myself and others down):Â Worthlessness, emptiness, guilt, indecision, crying a lot, preoccupied with death and suicide</li>
</ol>
