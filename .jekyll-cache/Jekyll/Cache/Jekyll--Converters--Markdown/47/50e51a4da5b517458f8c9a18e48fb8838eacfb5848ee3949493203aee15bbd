I"½<p>Self awareness is the ability to notice our thoughts, feelings and behaviour, as if we are an observer.
Self awareness allows us to understand ourselves and the impact we have on others. 
Self awareness is a tool that provides us with the power of choice, to redefine our narrative of how we experience ourselves. 
Through practicing self awareness, we can make new choices about how we live our lives and enhance our sense of wellbeing.</p>
