I"6<p>Listening is one of the most powerful tools for improving communication in our relationships. 
When we listen well to others, we indicate that we care about them and their experiences.  Listening is a skill that can be developed and improved over time. 
How can we listen well? 
Pay attention: 
Show curiosity and interest
Show you are listening by using non verbal feedback
Mirror the other personâ€™s body language, such as how they are sitting, to help the person feel you are connected with their experience. 
Reflect back to the speaker what you have heard them say. This allows the person to know that they have been heard. 
Ask clarifying questions. By clarifying with the other person what you have heard you show that you are motivated to really understand the message they are trying to communicate. This also helps the other person to clarify what they are trying to communicate. 
Invite the person to say more. By inviting the person to speak more, you help them feel that you are interested in understanding what they have to say. 
Do not interrupt the speaker by sharing your experiences opinions or beliefs in response to what you have heard. When we interrupt the process of listening we send the other person the message that we are not focused on their experience but are more concerned with sharing our own.</p>
