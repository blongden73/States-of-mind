<p>If we do not experience relationships that were attuned to our needs as children, we can lose trust in other peopleâ€™s ability to understand our inner world and come to feel that we must manage our problems alone, without the presence of another.</p>

<p>People with avoidant attachment styles protect themselves against childhood wounding and painful experiences by developing the belief that it is safer to manage feelings alone rather than trust another person to be able to provide them with the soothing and care taking behaviour that they require.</p>

<p>People with avoidant relationships styles may struggle with intimacy in relationships, as they may struggle to feel able to be vulnerable and honest about their emotional world in the presence of another person.</p>

<p>People with avoidant relationship patterns often act as if they do not need others when they are feeling vulnerable and become closed off when they experience difficulties in relationships.</p>
