<p>Growing numbers of young people in the UK are seeking help for their mental health, but many arenâ€™t getting the support they need. With the NHS unable to meet the rising demand, we believe itâ€™s time for a new approach, one that is co-created with young people outside of clinical settings.</p>

<p>By supporting young people to develop the skills, confidence, and knowledge to look after their mental health, we can help them find meaning and opportunity in the everyday struggles of life. We run trauma-informed mental health education programs in schools, giving young people the tools to explore their minds and emotions in a safe and familiar environment.</p>

<p>If young people are to thrive and live their potential, we need to make sure our societyâ€™s approach to mental health is working. We work alongside young people and psychologists to create social impact and research projects that enable young peopleâ€™s experiences, views and ideas to be a driving force for change.</p>
