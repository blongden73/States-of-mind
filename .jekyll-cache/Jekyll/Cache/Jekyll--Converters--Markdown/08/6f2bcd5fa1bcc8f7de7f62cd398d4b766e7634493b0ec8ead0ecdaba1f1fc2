I"Ç<p>Our definition of identity isnâ€™t fixed as we view it as a subjective and personal experience of how we chose to view ourselves.</p>

<p>Our identity relates to our self - image:Â  our perception of our value and our role in the world. Our identity changes and evolves as we develop, reflecting the dynamic inter-relationship between our life experience and our sense of self.</p>

<p>As our life history and identity are so closely related, exploring and bringing awareness to different aspects of our identity can provide an important foundation for self-discovery, self awareness and personal growth.Â </p>

<p>Exploring our identity can make us aware of past experiences that can bring up uncomfortable feelings and memories. While practicing these exercises, itâ€™s important to remember that your identity is never fixed and that giving ourselves space and time to process and feel our reactions to parts of our identity is part of the healing process.</p>
