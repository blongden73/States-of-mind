I"È<p>Feelings of stress, combined with our inner fears can cause us to retreat into avoidant behaviours that make us feel more comfortable and secure than risking potential scenarios that could cause more stress. 
The tendency to avoid situations that could cause us discomfort can help in the short term but in the long term can perpetuate feelings of anxiety as it reinforces our internal beliefs that we cannot cope with situations that challenge us.</p>
