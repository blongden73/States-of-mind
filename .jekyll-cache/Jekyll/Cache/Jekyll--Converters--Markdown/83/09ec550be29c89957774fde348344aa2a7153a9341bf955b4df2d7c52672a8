I"R<p>Step 1:</p>

<p>Choose what you want to work with. It’s often easier to begin with a person with whom you have difficulty (e.g., partner, relative, boss).</p>

<p>This person may irritate, disturb, annoy, or upset you. Or maybe you feel attracted to, obsessed with, infatuated with, or possessive about this person.</p>

<p>Choose someone with whom you have a strong emotional charge, whether positive or negative.</p>

<p>Step 2: Face it:</p>

<p>Now, imagine this person. Describe those qualities that most upset you, or the characteristics you are most attracted to using 3rd-person language (he, she, it).</p>

<p>Talk about them out loud or write it down in a journal. Express your feelings.</p>

<p>Don’t calculate the right thing to say. There is no need to be nice. The person you are describing will never see this.</p>

<p>Step 3:</p>

<p>Talk to it: Dialogue with this person in your imagination. Speak in the 2nd person to this person (using “you” language).</p>

<p>Talk directly to this person as if he or she was there. Tell them what bothers you about them.</p>

<p>Ask them questions such as:</p>

<p>Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want from me?
What are you trying to show me?
What do you have to teach me?
Imagine their response to these questions. Speak that imaginary response out loud. Record the conversation in your journal if you like.</p>

<p>Step 4:</p>

<p>Take on the qualities that either annoy or fascinate you.</p>

<p>Embody the traits you described in step 2. Use 1st-person language ( I, me, mine).</p>

<p>This may feel awkward, and it should. The traits you are taking on are the exact traits you have been denying in yourself.</p>

<p>Use statements such as:</p>

<p>I am angry.
I am jealous.
I am radiant.</p>

<p>Fill in the blank with whatever qualities you are working with: “I am <strong>__</strong><em>__</em>.”</p>

<p>Step 5: Notice these disowned qualities in yourself.</p>

<p>Experience the part of you that is this trait. Avoid making the process abstract or conceptual: just BE it.</p>

<p>Now you can re-own and integrate this quality in yourself.</p>
