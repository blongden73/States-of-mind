<p>Silence in conversation can make you feel uncomfortable and awkward. By interrupting to prevent silences you spend a message to the other person that you are not able to contain the feelings of discomfort in the listening process. By taking time to allow silence, or by using silence to summarise back to the listener what you have heard, you can help the listener to feel supported and better understood.</p>
