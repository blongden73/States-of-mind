I"Z<p>Personality comes from the greek word ‘persona’ which means mask.</p>

<p>Our personality refers to the different ways we express ourselves in the world and the many different ways we relate with other people. Together with our personality we all have an unchanging part of who we are that psychologists call the ‘Self’. This is the part of us that does not change over time or adapt to different circumstances, but is our essential nature.</p>

<p>Our Self is the part of us that is spontaneous and loving, that seeks to be known and is the experience of who we most fundamentally are.</p>
