<p>For the last couple of years we have been learning about what young people want mental health support to look like in education. We have designed our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme Wellbeing Ambassadors to explore and address the underlying issues affecting young people’s wellbeing. We work with students weekly, supporting them to design and lead a targeted intervention to improve wellbeing in their college.</p>

<p>We provide facilitation, support and psychological insight throughout the process. We aren’t interested in one off workshops, we want to create a completely new approach to supporting young people in education.</p>
