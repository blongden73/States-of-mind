I"l<p>Personality comes from the greek word ‘persona’ which means mask.</p>

<p>Your personality refers to the different ways you express yourself in the world and the many different ways you relate with other people.</p>

<p>Together with your personality you have an unchanging part of who you you are that psychologists call the ‘Self’. This is the part of you that does not change over time or adapt to different circumstances, but is your essential nature.</p>

<p>Your Self is the part of you that is spontaneous and loving, that seeks to be known and is the experience of who you most fundamentally are.</p>
