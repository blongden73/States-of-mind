<p>In Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms. One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress, Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.</p>

<p>Rumination happens when you become caught in a particular story about your life which limits your focus to repetitive thought patterns.</p>

<p>High levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety and low mood. </p>

<p>When you ruminate, you may feel trapped in your thinking and can’t see a way out. This makes you feel low and makes you believe that your thoughts are an accurate reflection of reality. But this is not the case.</p>

<p>Your mind is just one part of your experience and you can use it in many different ways. </p>
