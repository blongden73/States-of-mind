I"Â<p>Think of a scenario that currently exists in your life, where a friend, family member or somebody else that you know is acting in a way that is causing you frustration or a sense of disconnection.</p>

<p>Think about how has it made you feel and what assumptions you have automatically made about why they are acting this way.</p>

<p>This will help you mentalise yourself and bring awareness to the nature of your own feelings and reactions.</p>
