I"@<p>Compassion is the foundation for empathy, love and compromise in relationships. Compassion is an attitude and belief in equality and each persons right for their needs to be valued and understood for both their good qualities and their flaws. 
When we do not judge or criticise the behaviour of another person but take time to understand and work through problems together, we show ourselves and the other that we do not see problems in thee relationship as Indications of their worth but as an opportunity for growth and deeper levels of understanding and connection in our relationships. 
By respecting another person as having the same needs for love, connection and understanding as ourselves, we can overcome the judgement and limiting beliefs about others that can cause distance and misunderstanding in relationships.</p>
