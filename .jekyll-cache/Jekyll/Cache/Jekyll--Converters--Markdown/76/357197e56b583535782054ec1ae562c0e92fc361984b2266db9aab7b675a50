I"y<p>Our relationship with our family provides us with our first experiences of what relationships are like. The way that our parent/s responded to our needs for authenticity and connection in childhood shapes our understanding of whether we can trust others to meet these needs .<br />
If our family was present and attuned to what we needed and reflected back to us a positive sense of self, we will carry a sense of self worth and self-esteem into our adult relationships and will feel able to communicate openly and honesty about our emotional life. 
This process of reflecting back our authentic self is called ‘attunement’. 
If our parents punished us or were unavailable when we needed them emotionally, we may come to develop a belief that it is unsafe or uncomfortable expressing our needs with others as adults. This ‘non-attunement’ can have a significant impact on our sense of self worth, our ability to regulate our emotions and our mental health. 
Although no parent can meet all of our needs all of the time, the amount of attunement that they were able to provide has a direct impact on our mental health as an adult.</p>
