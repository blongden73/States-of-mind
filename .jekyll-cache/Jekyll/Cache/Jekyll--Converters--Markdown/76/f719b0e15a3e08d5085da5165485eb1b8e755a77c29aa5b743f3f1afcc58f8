<p>For a long time, psychiatrists believed that depression was caused by a lack of serotonin and dopamine in the brain as these are brain chemicals that are related to our mood and sense of motivation and enjoyment in life. So far, no research has been able to identify a causal relationship between neurochemistry and depression. Some people who have high levels of serotonin can experience chronic depression, as well as people with low levels.Â </p>

<p>The difficulty with identifying a single biological cause for depression is that there are many factors that contribute to our neurochemistry, such as the amount of exercise we do, the food we eat and the types of social environments that we live in.</p>
