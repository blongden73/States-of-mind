<p>Mental Health
We believe that the benefits of psychology and therapy should be available to everyone, especially 
those at an early stage in life.</p>

<p>By exploring our mind, emotions and behaviour, we can make sense of our world and move into adulthood with more confidence and purpose.</p>

<p>Through education, self exploration 
and project-led learning, our programme helps foster emotional intelligence and self awareness in 
young people.</p>

<p>Together 
Pioneering ideas emerge when we explore our problems together. â€¨And by tapping into the voices and experiences of this generation, we can create a future that works for everyone.</p>

<p>Infused with project-led learning, 
our programme sees students create 
a social impact project with the aim 
of improving the wellbeing of their community.
