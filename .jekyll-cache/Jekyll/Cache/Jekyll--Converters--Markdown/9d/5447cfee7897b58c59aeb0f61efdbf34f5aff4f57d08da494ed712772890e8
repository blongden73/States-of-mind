I"Ô<p>When we are distressed, distracted or experiencing conflict in our relationships, it affects our capacity to consider that another personâ€™s experience is different to our own.Â 
Without open communication, we make guesses and assumptions about what is going on in other peopleâ€™s minds. 
We assume that other people think in the way that we do 
We project our own feelings and past experiences onto other people 
We make quick decisions about the meaning of other peopleâ€™s behaviour without taking time to check it out with them 
We do not take time to consider how other people have different experiences than our own 
When people are threatened they may hold back their feelings and thoughts about a situation</p>
