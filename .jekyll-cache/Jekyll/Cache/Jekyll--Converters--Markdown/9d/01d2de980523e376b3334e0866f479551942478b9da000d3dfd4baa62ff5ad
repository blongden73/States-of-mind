I"ä<p>People experiencing depression can become very identified with their mind, as a way to escape difficult feelings and internal beliefs.</p>

<p>This can lead to rumination, which is the habit of becoming caught in repetitive and ongoing cycles of negative evaluations about ourselves.</p>

<p>This is why many therapies and approaches to depression focus on observing our thoughts, introducing more positive activities into our lives or speaking with others about our problems.</p>
