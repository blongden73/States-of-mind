I"Ÿ<p>Mindfulness has been described by Jon Kabat Zinn asâ€™ paying attention in a particular way; on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgementally.â€™</p>

<p>Mindfulness allows us to take a new perspective on our experience, one that is characterised by openness, curiosity and acceptance. This allows us to strengthen brain networks that enable us to view our thoughts as mental events rather than permanent and factual aspects of our experience.</p>

<p>Recent research has found that young people who took part in mindfulness programmes experience a range of beneficial outcomes including reduced depression, improved coping skills, improved mood, and improved post-traumatic stress symptoms.</p>

<p>AÂ reviewÂ of nine clinical trials analyzing people with severe depression found MBCT reduced a patientâ€™s chances of relapsing for up to 60 weeks, regardless of their sex, age, education or relationship status.</p>
