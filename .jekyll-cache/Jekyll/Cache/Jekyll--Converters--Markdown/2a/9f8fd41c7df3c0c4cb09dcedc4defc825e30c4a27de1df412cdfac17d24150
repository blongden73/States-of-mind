I"<p>The inner child practice is a therapeutic process that allows us to reconnect with our essential nature.</p>

<p>As young children, we do not change or adapt our behaviour for others but express our needs, interests and sense of self authentically.</p>

<p>By reconnecting with our younger self, we can discover and reintegrate lost qualities of ourselves and bring them into our present lives more fully.</p>

<p>This is a therapeutic process that can help us to develop our self awareness and self esteem.</p>
