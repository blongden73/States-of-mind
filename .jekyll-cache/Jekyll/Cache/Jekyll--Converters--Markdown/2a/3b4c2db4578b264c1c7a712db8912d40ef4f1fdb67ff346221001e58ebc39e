I"]<p>When you experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected in your body as tension and discomfort.</p>

<p>One of the ways you may manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into your mind. You probably donâ€™t realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to bring awareness to yourself in the present moment and reconnect with your body as a way to calm yourself and rebalance your mood.</p>

<p>By dancing, stretching, exercising or going for a walk, you can bring your awareness into your body, which will help your mind to slow down and relax.</p>
