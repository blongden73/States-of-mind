I"6<p>The anxiety response begins in a part of the brain called the Amygdala. We share this part of the brain with all animals, as it is one of the most fundamental survival systems that allows us to detect threats in our environment.</p>

<p>Animal studies have shown that if you remove the amygdala, the animal loses any sense of fear or anxiety. </p>

<p>The amygdala is activated in response to situations of fear and uncertainty. Once activated, this part of the brain sends a message through the vagus nerve to activate our parasympathetic nervous system. </p>
