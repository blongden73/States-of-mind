<p>Sometimes the rational mind can get so caught up in facts and information that we already know or want to understand that we forget to use our imagination to consider how it can be used in other ways and also how other people have made sense of the information from their own perspective.</p>

<p>Everybody has a different perspective and so information can seem very different to different people. The way that you interpret the information depends on who is teaching you, your experiences of the information before and what you want to use the information to do.</p>

<p>If you want to use the information to add to your beliefs about something then this means that you will often learn the information in a way that serves your beliefs, rather than in a way that can be discussed and changes over time.Â </p>
