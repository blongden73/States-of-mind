<p>2021/22 - Refining &amp; implementing the Review of Progress and Development</p>

<p>A new cohort of students are coming together from late September. Again, a PAR approach will be employed. They will work with States of Mind practitioners, students from previous phases and an IOE doctorate student to develop an understanding of phases one-three, then refine the RPD. This will be followed by implementation of the RPD and evaluation of the process alongside students and educators across a number of schools, including School 21 and London Academy of Excellence in Newham borough and (hopefully) other schools.</p>

<p>The students involved in this exciting phase are beginning to formulate their aims for the year. It will be fascinating to see how the RPD develops and the response of school leaders and teachers when taking part in this alternative evaluation approach. We hope that as phase 4 comes to fruition, Breaking the Silence will:</p>

<p>promote conversation about how education is evaluated, show how young people can work together to create actionable, psychologically healthy alternatives to current education systems, prompt people to consider the positioning of young people in the big decisions that affect their lives and the extent to which they are currently disempowered, present an actionable education evaluation tool that meets the needs of diverse young people and can be applied across education provisions.</p>
