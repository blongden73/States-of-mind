I"<p>Experiencing a Threat</p>

<p>When we experience a threat, the vagus nerve sends a message to our digestive system to stop producing digestive enzymes and to stop ourselves feeling hungry so that we can focus our energy and resources on responding to the threat around us. This is why when we feel stressed and anxious, we feel butterflies in our stomach and other uncomfortable feelings in our belly. </p>

<p>Feelings Stressed and Overwhelmed</p>

<p>When we are stressed and overwhelmed, we are more likely to become ill and are vulnerable to catching a cold or suffering from other illnesses related to the immune system. When the parasympathetic nervous system is active, it suppresses the immune response in the body.</p>

<p>Health problems and inflammation</p>

<p>When the calming effects of the vagus nerve are inhibited through stress, our body can experience inflammation and this can lead to a range of health conditions. There is an extensive body of research that links inflammation to chronic health conditions. Stress impairs functioning of the nervous system which produces this inflammation and therefore it is important to use the body’s natural mechanism - breathing, to maintain balance and bring the balance of the body back to its healthy state. </p>
