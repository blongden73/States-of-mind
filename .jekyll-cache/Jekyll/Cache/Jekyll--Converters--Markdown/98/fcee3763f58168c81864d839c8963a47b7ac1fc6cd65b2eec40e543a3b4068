I"µ<p>Self awareness is the experience of noticing your thoughts, feelings and behaviour, as if you are an observer.</p>

<p>It also allows you to step back and understand yourself and how you are affected by other people.</p>

<p>By developing your levels of self awareness, you can access a sense of choice around how you respond to lifeâ€™s challenges. OverÂ time, you can experience a deep connection with your most authentic self.</p>
