I"ð<p>We came into being in 2017, as
an organisation advocating for
new ways of thinking about
mental health.</p>

<p>Our mission is create a world
where everyone has the tools to
maintain a healthy identity as they
move through life.</p>

<p>And weâ€™re well on our way:
collaborating with a range of
London schools and community
organisations, weâ€™re building a
model that gives young people an
opportunity to develop emotional
intelligence and self awareness as
part of their everyday life.</p>
