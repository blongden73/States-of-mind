I"#<p>**Calming our fears **</p>

<p>Exploring limiting and supportive beliefs.
When you provide space to listen to your fears, you give room for your fears to move away.</p>

<p><strong>What is fear?</strong></p>

<p>Fears are trapped feelings that come from our thoughts and experiences. Our fears are simply emotional energies that need to be listened to and allowed to pass. When we do not listen to our fears, they become trapped and begin to alter our perception of who we really are.</p>

<p>**Fear and limiting beliefs **</p>

<p>Our fears are there to help us understand what we have been thinking about and to help us understand how our unhelpful beliefs that we have created can cause us to feel uncomfortable and unable to live in the ways that we deserve. Calming our fears is possible for everyone. It requires us to listen carefully to the messages they hold and listen with kindness to what they are telling us about the beliefs that we have so that we can uncover the beliefs, explore them and let them go.</p>

<p>Think about the last time you were afraid or had a feeling that was fearful and uncomfortable. Can you notice how there is a belief that exists alongside this feeling?</p>

<p>See if you can notice what this belief is and where it came from.</p>

<p>Was it the situation or did you create the belief yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Where do limiting beliefs come from?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, our beliefs come from other people after they tell us something that makes us feel we cannot do something or cannot overcome our difficulties. Most often our beliefs come from ourselves because we find that beliefs make us feel more comfortable and secure but actually beliefs often keep us stuck when they cause us to think In certain ways about who we are.</p>

<p>Fears and beliefs come hand in hand, so by exploring our beliefs about ourselves we can understand and calm our fears.</p>

<p>**So how do you explore your beliefs? **</p>

<p>Our beliefs exist within us and they influence the way that we speak to ourselves and think about other people and situations. Letâ€™s do an activity that allows you to explore your beliefs.</p>

<p>**What are the things that you believe you cannot do? **</p>

<p>Write a list of the things that you believe you cannot do, or struggle with doing.</p>

<p>Now, answer the following questions:</p>

<p>Q. Do you feel feelings of fear when you think about doing these things?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. What feelings do you have that are attached to your beliefs about the things that you cannot do?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. How do these beliefs affect your ability to do the task?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Beliefs are ways of managing difficult situations. When we donâ€™t know the answer to something, we create a belief to help us feel like we know the outcome of the situation. People have beliefs about lots of different things. They have beliefs about who they are, they have beliefs about the things they can do and they have beliefs about other people, other groups and other situations that are happening.</p>

<p>**Limiting beliefs and supportive beliefs **</p>

<p>Some beliefs are attached to positive emotions and some beliefs have uncomfortable emotions attached to them. When a belief has an uncomfortable emotion attached to it, we call it a limiting belief. When a belief has a positive emotion attached to it we call it a supportive belief.</p>

<p>Why donâ€™t you explore some of your supportive beliefs and see how these supportive beliefs have helped you in the past?</p>

<p>Think of a situation where you had a belief that was connected with a positive emotion. What happened in this situation where you brought your supportive belief to a task, situation or personal relationship. Notice how the belief made you act and notice how the belief had an effect on the way that you approached what you did.</p>
