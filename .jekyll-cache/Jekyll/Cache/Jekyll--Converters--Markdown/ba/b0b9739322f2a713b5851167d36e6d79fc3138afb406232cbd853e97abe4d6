I"è<p>SubpersonalitiesÂ are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have followed since childhood</p>

<p>When people fail to respond empathetically to our true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents or our environment need us to be. A psychotherapist called Winnicott, called this process of adapting, the development of the â€˜False Selfâ€™. It is also referred to as the Survival Personality.Â </p>

<p>These are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that we develop to adapt to various environments where we feel unable to be our authentic self. In neuroscience these are viewed as distinct neural networks that function as â€˜specialised selvesâ€™ or â€˜self statesâ€™. ( Siegel 1993)Â </p>

<p>Daniel Stern summarises the psychological view on these multiple selves: â€˜ It is now largely accepted that there are multiple ( context -specific) selves that can interact with each other, observe each other, and converse together out of consciousness. This is normal, not limited to pathological dissociative states.â€™ (Stern 2004)Â </p>

<p>Sub-personality theory explains personality development and helps to explain why parts of our personality can feel conflicted and as if there are â€˜multiple selvesâ€™ within us who have different ways of being.</p>

<p>For example the feeling of â€˜ I want to do this but another part of me wants to do thatâ€™, or â€˜ I shouldnâ€™t be getting angry right now but I think its important I tell the truthâ€™</p>
