I"¿<p>There are 3 distinct states that you can become conscious to that are both separate from each other and inter-related:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mental states</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emotional states</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Physical states</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You may naturally be more connected with either your body, feelings or mind and each person has their own unique relationship to all three, like a fingerprint or personal map.</p>
