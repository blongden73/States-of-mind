<p>Launched in Newham in 2019, our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme provides schools with training and resources for schools to create an approach to wellbeing that is informed and led by students. Weâ€™re designing a model that helps students develop self awareness and emotional intelligence as part of their academic life.</p>

<p>Framed around three key elements, the program is underpinned by a project-led approach where students harness their insights to create a social impact.</p>
