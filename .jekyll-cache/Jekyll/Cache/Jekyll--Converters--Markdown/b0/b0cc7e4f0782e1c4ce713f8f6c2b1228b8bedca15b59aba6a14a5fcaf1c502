<p>In Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms. One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress, Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.</p>

<p>Rumination happens when we become caught in a particular story about our lives which limits our focus to repetitive thought patterns.</p>

<p>High levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety and low mood. </p>

<p>When we ruminate, we often feel trapped in our thinking and can’t see a way out. This makes us feel low and makes us believe that our life is our thoughts. But this is not the case.</p>

<p>Our mind is just one part of our experience and we can use it in many different ways. </p>
