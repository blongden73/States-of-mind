I"›"<p><em>With our youth-led research project, Breaking The Silence, weâ€™re exploring the impact of the UKâ€™s educational system on young peopleâ€™s mental health and wellbeing. Today we hear from Jaspar Khawaja, a doctoral student at the UCL Institute of Education, who has been collaborating with us in recent months to develop the research.</em></p>

<p>In our previous study, student researchers produced a two-part questionnaire which was answered by 247 young people in a London college. The student respondents asserted that the education system directly contributes to the deterioration of the mental health of many young people.</p>

<p>To expand on these findings, our student researchers wanted to investigate in more depth through focus groups, thus providing a forum in which students could offer thoughts on the pressing issues in the education system and how things might be improved.</p>

<p>What struck me most, during the focus groups with young people was how clearly they could explain problems relating to their educational and mental health experiences, and their capacity to suggest improvements.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>

<p>Once again, we used a <a href="https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/09/28/young-people-education-research.html">Participatory Action Research (PAR)</a> approach in which student researchers, alongside State of Mind practitioners, devised the methodology and analysed the data. I conducted four online focus groups after student researchers identified relevant questions. Eleven young people from four different London schools volunteered to take part in the research, responding to adverts sent out by their colleges. Our research questions were:</p>

<p><strong>- What impact do school examinations have on young people throughout their time in education?</strong></p>

<p><strong>- What impact does the education system have on young peopleâ€™s mental wellbeing?</strong></p>

<p><strong>- What does personal development mean to you during adolescence?</strong></p>

<p><strong>- How do young people think their educational experiences could be improved?</strong></p>

<p>This thematic map to the left highlights the topics that were discussed during the focus groups.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/Findings%201.jpg" alt="Findings 1.jpg" /></p>

<p>We conducted a thematic analysis to analyse the core themes discussed in the focus groups. The student researchers supported the analysis and decided which quotes should be used to communicate the themes. Some of the key findings are below.</p>

<h3 id="theme-1-individual-differences-are-not-currently-accounted-for-in-educational-practices">Theme 1: Individual differences are not currently accounted for in educational practices.</h3>

<p>The exam system was said to be â€œbiased to certain studentsâ€ and â€œdoesnâ€™t really cater to like different types of peopleâ€. Additionally, young people acknowledged that amongst their peers, some â€œcan deal with stress betterâ€ but the education system can be â€œtoo muchâ€ for many young people.</p>

<h3 id="theme-2-concerns-about-mental-health-and-wellbeing">Theme 2: Concerns about mental health and wellbeing</h3>

<p>The students pointed out that â€œpanic attacksâ€, â€œfeeling depressedâ€ and â€œeating disordersâ€ were common experiences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œWhether or not [mental health problems] are directly caused by schoolâ€¦ itâ€™s made worse by the education system,â€ commented a student.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They asserted that the way mental health is discussed in schools is â€œoutdatedâ€ and â€œcringyâ€, and a lack of support and understanding means that young people are often â€œacting as counsellorsâ€ for one another. Young people talked about feeling emotionally vulnerable and raised concerns that mental health problems are â€œnormalisedâ€ amongst their peer group. They felt that this should not be the case for teenagers.</p>

<h3 id="theme-3-impact-of-the-education-system-on-the-formation-of-student-identity">Theme 3: Impact of the education system on the formation of student identity</h3>

<p>Students reflected that personal development was closely tied to an individualâ€™s identity, describing it as â€œbeing able to understand yourself and understanding how you cope with stress.â€ However, participants described â€œan identity crisisâ€ amongst young people where they â€œthink this is who I am now, Iâ€™m a studentâ€. They talked about how they â€œput so much energy and so much stress and time into schoolâ€, meaning they donâ€™t have the time to figure out who they are outside of education. Extracurricular activities were frequently discussed as being â€œidentity formingâ€ and as allowing students to discover their interests. But it was consistently suggested that little time exists to pursue these. This raises questions of how personal development can be brought into the curriculum.</p>

<h3 id="theme-4-schools-prioritise-academic-achievement-over-mental-health-and-wellbeing">Theme 4: Schools prioritise academic achievement over mental health and wellbeing</h3>

<p>The students expressed that the underlying message always seems to be, you still need to prioritise your studies above all else. They felt that the school system does not â€œvalue your mental health as much as they value your academic successâ€. The competitive nature of the education system was generally said to have a negative impacts as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œYou always end up feeling like youâ€™re not doing enough in comparison to other peopleâ€â€¦ â€œIf youâ€™re not doing as well as everyone else, then youâ€™re going to be a failure.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="theme-5-the-importance-of-relationships">Theme 5: The importance of relationships</h3>

<p>The young people discussed how the education system should provide them with the opportunity â€œto be introduced to different types of peopleâ€ and learn from others. They also described the impact of â€œamazing teachersâ€ who push them to be better, not just academically but â€œas a person.â€ Although this can be really positive, the students felt there needs to be increased â€œemphasis on a mutual connection or mutual trust between teachers and studentsâ€, and:</p>

<p>â€œTeachers should be trained a little bit more on how to build a connection with their studentsâ€â€¦ â€œgiving guidance on not just lessons but life as wellâ€.</p>

<h3 id="theme-6-suggested-changes-to-the-education-system">Theme 6: Suggested changes to the education system</h3>

<p>Participants offered a range of improvements to the exam system, such as having â€œdifferent ways of assessing like your competence and skillsâ€ involving â€œpersonal inputâ€ to develop curiosity rather than â€œworking and learning for someone else.â€ They felt the removal of coursework has negatively impacted their emotional wellbeing and potential attainment. Young people strongly asserted that they need to have more space to relax and socialise because â€œif your mindâ€™s preoccupied with studyingâ€¦ you just donâ€™t think itâ€™s very important to really figure out your own identityâ€.</p>

<p>The young people questioned assumptions about the purpose of education system that many have come to accept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œSchool doesnâ€™t only have to be for learningâ€¦ it doesnâ€™t only have to be a space for academic achievement. I feel like it can be so many other things. Because I feel like part of developing and growing up is a lot more than just your gradesâ€.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h2>

<p>In this study young people questioned the overwhelming focus of the education system on academic achievement as a sole priority, at a cost to their wellbeing and growth as individuals. They indicated that the exam system results in unhealthy competition, student disempowerment, a lack of focus on the development of relationships and little recognition of individual diversity. In addition, they felt that skills and qualities that arenâ€™t easily quantified are not valued in the education system, to the detriment of their personal development.</p>

<p>The research shows that young people are able to offer eloquent critique of the education system based on their experiences and have a range of thoughts on improvements. Their views must be placed at the centre of all decisions made in regards to the purpose of their education provision.</p>

<p><strong>We are continuing to develop the <a href="https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/09/16/breaking-the-silence.html">Breaking The Silence</a> project in collaboration with UCL Institute of Education. The next stage will see us work with a group of students to reimagine educational assessment. Stay tuned.</strong></p>
