I"<p>Paul Gilbert, an Evolutionary Psychologist has proposed that people feel anxiety as a response to social comparison, as people are hardwired to pay attention to their social status within groups.</p>

<p>This can cause us to feel fear related to social situations, like the fear of rejection or not being accepted by others.</p>

<p>As one of our primary needs is a sense of belonging, connection and acceptance, our threat system becomes active when we perceive a threat to our attachment needs for love and belonging.</p>
