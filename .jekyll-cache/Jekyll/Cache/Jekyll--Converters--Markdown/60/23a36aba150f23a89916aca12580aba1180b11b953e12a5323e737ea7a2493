I"D<p>We are interested in how individuals are influenced by systems and how systems can be improved to support young peopleâ€™s wellbeing.</p>

<p>From family, friendships, education to society, the systems we inhabit shape our views of ourselves and the world.</p>

<p>To improve mental health, we must design psychologically healthy environments for the next generation. We must innovate, from the bottom up.</p>

<p>Our work focuses on listening to young people and working with them to create new models of psychological support that are non clinical and non pathologizing.</p>
