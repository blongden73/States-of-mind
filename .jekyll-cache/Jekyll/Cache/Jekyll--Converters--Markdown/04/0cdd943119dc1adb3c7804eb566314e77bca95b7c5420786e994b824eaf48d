I"<<p>Breathing exercises are one of the best ways to reduce stress in the body. 
When we practice slow and deep breathing, it activates the vagus nerve which sends a signal to the brain that allows the body to relax.<br />
Breathing exercises help to quiet the mind and return our awareness to the present moment.</p>
