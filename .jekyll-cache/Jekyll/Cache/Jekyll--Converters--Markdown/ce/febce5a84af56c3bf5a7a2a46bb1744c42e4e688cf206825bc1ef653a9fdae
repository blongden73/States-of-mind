<p>2019/20 - What is the impact of schooling on the identity, psychological health and personal development of young people?</p>

<p>The following year, a new cohort of students considered the outcomes of phase one and decided to take the project in a different direction. They constructed questionnaires and co-facilitated focus groups and interviews with the support of an IOE doctorate student. Check out the summary of findings from the <a href="https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/11/04/the-impact-of-school-on-students-mental-health.html">questionnaire</a> and <a href="https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/11/04/academic-over-wellbeing-young-people.html">focus groups</a>. A disturbing picture emerged of an education system that values results above human flourishing, stifles creativity, identity, personal development and often negatively impacts the mental health of young people. They asserted many ideas for educational evolution, including increased “personal input” to curricula, “different ways of assessing” and valuing mental health and individuality. Two <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/states-of-mind-bea-herbert-mISWTHu1Cek/">podcasts</a> were also put together by States of Mind alongside student participants, to further bring the findings to life. One of the student leaders, <a href="https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/10/21/education-system-and-identity.html">Reegan Mason</a>, wrote a piece outlining the emerging issues and ideas for innovation.</p>
