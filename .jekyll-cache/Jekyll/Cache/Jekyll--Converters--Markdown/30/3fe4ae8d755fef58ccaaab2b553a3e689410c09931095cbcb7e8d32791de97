I"þ<p>If you have experienced this type of relational environment growing up, you are likely to become easily upset and anxious if the other person in the relationship withdraws emotionally or physically from you. The reason for this is because you have come to believe that your emotional wellbeing is reliant on the emotional wellbeing of another person.</p>

<p>You may become enmeshed in the emotional life of our partner, friends or family, instead of prioritising your own emotional needs and feeling confident in your ability to express these in your relationships.</p>

<p>This can lead you feeling that you are undeserving of love and attention and that other peopleâ€™s needs are more important than your own.</p>

<p>If you have this type of relationship pattern you may find yourself in relationships where you feel misunderstood and resentful. You may idealise and put your partner on a pedestal or find yourself engaging in manipulative behaviour in an attempt to not lose your partners attention and care.</p>
