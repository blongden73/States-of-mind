<p>In Mind-Body Therapy the body itself becomes a record of everything that has happened and will elucidate the story that is manifesting in symptoms. One of these symptoms is overthinking as a result of built up tension and stress, Psychologists call this ‘rumination’.</p>

<p>Rumination happens when we become caught in a particular story about our lives which limits our focus to repetitive thought patterns.</p>

<p>High levels of rumination are linked with feelings of panic, anxiety and low mood. </p>

<p>When we ruminate, we often feel trapped in our thinking and can’t see a way out. This makes us feel low and makes us believe that our life is our thoughts. But this is not the case. Our mind is just one part of our experience and we can use it in many different ways. </p>
