I"ì<p>A Psychologist called Donald Winnicott coined this term to refer to the fact that no parent can meet your needs all of the time and that no parenting style can be completely perfect.</p>

<p>Your parents are individuals with their own potentially unmet needs and relational patterns that have been played out from their childhoods.</p>

<p>Although no parent can meet all of your needs all of the time, the amount of attunement that they were able to provide has been shown to influence the quality of your relationships as an adult.</p>

<p>If your parents punished you or were unavailable when you needed them emotionally, you may come to develop a belief that it is unsafe or uncomfortable expressing your needs with others as an adult.</p>
