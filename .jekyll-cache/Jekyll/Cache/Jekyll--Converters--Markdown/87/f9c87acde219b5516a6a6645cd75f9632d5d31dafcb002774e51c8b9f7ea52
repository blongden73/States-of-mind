I"'<p>We live in a social world and many aspects of our personalities are shaped by the social relationships and situations we encounter throughout our lives.</p>

<p>As it is impossible for our close relationships to be fully present all the time and for us to be completely present to others, we have adapted a way to fit our environments by adapting our personality to defend ourselves or meet your need for connection.</p>

<p>An example of this is noticing when somebody seems to have a different personality depending on what group they are in, or when we notice we behave differently depending on who we are. This is a completely normal process but understanding the process behind it can help us develop an awareness of how parts of our identity are shaped by our desire to fit in and be accepted.</p>
