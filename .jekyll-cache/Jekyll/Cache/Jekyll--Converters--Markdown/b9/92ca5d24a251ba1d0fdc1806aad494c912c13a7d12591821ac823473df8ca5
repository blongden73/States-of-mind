I"<p>If we have experienced this type of relational environment growing up, we are likely to become easily upset and anxious if the other person in the relationship withdraws emotionally or physically from us. The reason for this is because we have come to believe that our emotional wellbeing is reliant on the emotional wellbeing of another person.</p>

<p>We may become enmeshed in the emotional life of our partner, friends or family, instead of prioritising our own emotional needs and feeling confident in our ability to express these in our relationships.</p>

<p>This can lead to a feeling in our relationships, that we are undeserving of love and attention and that our partnerâ€™s needs are more important than ours.</p>

<p>People who have experienced this type of relationship pattern may find themselves in relationships where they feel misunderstood and resentful. They may idealise and put their partner on a pedestal or find themselves engaging in manipulative behaviour in an attempt to not lose their partners attention and care.</p>
