I":<p>Melanie Klein was a psychologist who focuses on the relationships between parents and children. She coined the term ‘splitting’ to describe a psychological defence that young children develop to manage ambivalent feelings towards their parents. 
As young children we manage difficult feelings in relationships by engaging in a process called ‘splitting’. 
This process ‘splits’ our perception of our parents into either a ‘good parent’ or a ‘bad parent’. 
This process causes feelings of either idealisation in relationships or feelings of resentment and an inability to see the other persons good qualities. 
Healthy relationships require that we are able to tolerate ambivalence in relationships and are able to love another person while experiencing both their positive and difficult behaviours.</p>
