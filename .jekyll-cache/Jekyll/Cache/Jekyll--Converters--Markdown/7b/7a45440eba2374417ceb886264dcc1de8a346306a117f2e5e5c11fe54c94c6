<h2 id="step-1">Step 1.</h2>

<p>Reflect on the mindsets you have around some of the following things:</p>

<p>Education, romantic relationships, social media, politics, the future.</p>

<p>Choose one of the areas to focus on.</p>

<p>Write down whatever views and mindsets you have around this topic.</p>

<p>Take time to reflect on each statement you have written and consider how strongly you hold these mindsets.</p>

<p>Rate each mindset on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the strongest.</p>

<p>Choose one of the strongest mindsets you have to work with in step 2.</p>

<h2 id="step-2">Step 2:</h2>

<p>How does this mindset serve you? ( How has it helped you or provided you with something?)</p>

<p>How does this mindset limit you? ( How does it hold you back or prevent you from seeing other perspectives of yourself and others?)</p>

<p>If you detach from this mindset, what other ways of seeing yourself and others begin to emerge?</p>
