I"o<p>Carl Jung was a Swiss Psychologist who explored the personality and human nature. He was responsible for introducing concepts such as introversion and extroversion and the collective unconcious. 
Jung believed that ‘individuation’ was a process that was the main purpose of human development. This idea was that psychological health is achieved by seeking to live authentically ( to feel and act in accordance with who we most essentially are).  He believed that everybody had the ability and the impulse to move towards our fullest potential  and that we achieved this by becoming aware of aspects of ourselves we ignore or are unconscious to, aswell as the unmanifested potential that exists within us. 
For Jung, healing was a process of reconnecting with our true nature and rediscovering our unique and personal interests, desires and ways of being in the world.</p>
