I"¥<p>Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing our awareness to the present moment consciously and non-judgementally.</p>

<p>Often, our thoughts become preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on our past or overanalysing our personal experiences.</p>

<p>Through mindfulness, we can â€˜step backâ€™ and become attuned to our present moment experience and step back from our attachment to thinking.</p>
