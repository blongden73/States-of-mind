I"?<p>Sub-personality theory explains personality development and helps to explain why parts of your personality can feel conflicted sometimes, as if there are ‘multiple selves’ within you who have different ways of being.</p>

<p>For example, you may have a part of you that is very rebellious and another part of you that is very responsible.</p>

<p>By exploring these different aspects of our personality we can develop a deeper understanding of the difference between our internal sense of who we are most essentially and the different ways we behave in the world.</p>
