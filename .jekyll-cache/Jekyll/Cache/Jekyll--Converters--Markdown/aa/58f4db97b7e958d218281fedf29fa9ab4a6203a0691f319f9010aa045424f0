I"<p>Paul Gilbert, an Evolutionary Psychologist has proposed that people feel anxiety as a response to social comparison, as people are hardwired to pay attention to their social status within groups.</p>

<p>This can cause you to feel fear related to social situations, like the fear of rejection or not being accepted by others.</p>

<p>As one of your primary needs is a sense of belonging, connection and acceptance, your threat system becomes active when you perceive that your attachment needs for love and belonging are threatened.</p>
