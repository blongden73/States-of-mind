<p>The first lesson in using your mind more effectively is to observe its tendency to become distracted by intruding thoughts. </p>

<p>Your mind likes to comment on our experiences. It comments on everything, from how you are feeling, to what you think about other people and the experiences you have.</p>

<p>The mind is always changing because your mood is always changing. You run into problems with the mind when you begin to believe that everything you are thinking is the only experience that is possible. </p>
