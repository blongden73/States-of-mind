I"V<p>The Self is our ‘core self ’ , which never changes throughout our lives, it is a state of consciousness and witnessing of experiencing.</p>

<p>The ‘I’ identifies with the aspects of our experience, like our thoughts, emotions, behaviour and many parts of ourselves. The I is what we experience as your personal self and what we see as who we are.</p>

<p>The ‘I’ identifies with our sub personalities, which is why we experience them as so personal, as when we are connected with a sub personality we experience it as our full self in the moment and believe that is all we are.</p>
