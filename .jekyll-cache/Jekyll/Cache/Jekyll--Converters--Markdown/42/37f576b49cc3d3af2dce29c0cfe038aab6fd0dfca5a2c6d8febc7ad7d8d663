I"<p>When we experience difficult thoughts and emotions, this becomes reflected in our body as tension and discomfort. We can release this tension and discomfort by bringing awareness to our body and physical experience.</p>

<p>One of the ways we manage painful  emotional experiences is to escape into our minds. Often we don’t realise this is happening at the time and that is why it is important to bring awareness to ourselves in the present moment and reconnect with our bodies as a way to calm ourselves and rebalance our mood.</p>

<p>Dance movement psychotherapy is effective because it allows us to learn how this process works as it allows us to experience the power of how we can use our bodies to influence our mood and release trapped and difficult emotions. </p>
