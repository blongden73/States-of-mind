I"´<p>Self awareness is the experience of noticing our thoughts, feelings and behaviour, as if we are an observer.</p>

<p>It also allows us to step back and understand both ourselves and how we are in relationship with others.</p>

<p>By developing our levels of self awareness, we can access a sense of choice around how we respond to lifeâ€™s challenges. Over time, we can experience a deep connection with our most authentic self.</p>
