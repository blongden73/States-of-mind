I"±<p><strong>Self Awareness has been proven as a tool that can help us to flourish.</strong></p>

<p>The insight that self awareness provides allows us to feel more satisfied with our lives.</p>

<p>When cultivated fully, we no longer repress or hide our emotions or experiences and instead see them as ways to learn and grow.</p>

<p>Self awareness allows us to develop insight into our problems, behaviours and personal experiences.</p>

<p>This process of bringing conscious awareness to how we are living is the first step to having confidence that we can change our lives to be more positive and fulfilling. Without this insight and this belief in change, it is very difficult to know we can develop ourselves and we can become stuck feeling as if we have no control over how things are.</p>
