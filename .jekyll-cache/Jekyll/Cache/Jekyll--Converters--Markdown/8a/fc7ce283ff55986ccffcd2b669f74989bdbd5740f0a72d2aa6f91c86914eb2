I"¹<p>Relationships come to an end for many reasons. They may end out of personal choice or for reasons outside of our control. Ending relationships can be difficult if we feel a sense of loyalty for the other person or if we have been avoiding ending the relationship out of fear of the consequences.<br />
Consciously ending a relationship in a healthy way is a skill that we can develop which can have benefits for our emotional wellbeing.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recognise that if a relationship is not feeling right for you, it will not be an appropriate relationship for the other person either.</li>
  <li>Recognise that ending a relationship will bring up emotions for both people involved in the ending and creating space for both peopleâ€™s experiences to be heard and respected is crucial for both people to feel acknowledged in the ending. 
3.Be emotionally honest about the reasons for wanting to end the relationship. Being emotionally honest does not involve blaming or criticising the other person but describing your personal feelings using â€˜Iâ€™ statements not â€˜Youâ€™ statements.</li>
  <li>Do not send mixed messages but be clear about your reasons for wanting to end the relationship.</li>
</ol>
