I"_<p>Everyday we have an experience of who we are. Sometimes this is a positive experience that affirms a clear and motivated sense of ourselves in the world, while at other times we can experience ourselves as struggling, unable to cope and helpless to our challenges.</p>

<p>Our mental health is reflected in our self image and so by developing the ability to reflect on ourselves we can develop more emotional and mental flexibility over how we experience our self image. This skill can be developed throughout life and is crucial for our mental health, relationships and general enjoyment of life.Â </p>
