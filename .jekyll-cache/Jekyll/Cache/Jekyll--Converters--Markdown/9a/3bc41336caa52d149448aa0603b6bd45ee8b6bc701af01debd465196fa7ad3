I"¥<p>The vagus nerve connects your brain to many important organs throughout your body, including your stomach, heart and lungs.</p>

<p>The vagus nerve is also a key part of your parasympathetic â€œrest and digestâ€ nervous system. It influences your breathing, digestive function and heart rate, all of which can have a huge impact on your mental health.</p>

<p>Having higher vagal tone means that your body can relax faster after stress as increasing the â€˜toneâ€™ of your vagus nerve activates the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
