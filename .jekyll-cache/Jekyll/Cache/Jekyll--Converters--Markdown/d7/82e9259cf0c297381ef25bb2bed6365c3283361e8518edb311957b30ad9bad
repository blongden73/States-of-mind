I"<p>Psychodynamic Therapy is a medium to long term therapy that usually takes place in a 1-1 context. The therapy provides a supportive environment that allows you to talk openly with someone who’s objective, neutral and nonjudgmental.</p>

<p>Family therapy allows members of a family, couples or other groups of people who care about each other to work through their difficult experiences safely in the presence of a therapist. The therapy focuses on supportive people to value their own and each others needs and explore their problems collaboratively.</p>

<p>One study compared systemic family therapy with psychodynamic therapy for depression and found that both groups improved significantly.</p>

<p>After 6-months, 100% of the children in psychodynamic therapy and 81% in family therapy no longer met criteria for depression.</p>

<p>Both groups saw the same dramatic increase in the child’s overall functioning.</p>

<p>None of the participants in either group experienced returning depressive symptoms over the 6-month period.</p>
