I"ß<p>SubpersonalitiesÂ are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have followed since childhood</p>

<p>When people fail to respond empathetically to our true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents or our environment need us to be.</p>

<p>A psychotherapist called Winnicott also called this process of adapting, the development of the False Self. It has also been referred to as the Survival Personality or â€˜Character Armourâ€™.Â </p>
