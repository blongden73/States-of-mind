I"ð<p>SubpersonalitiesÂ are habits or patterns of behaviour that you have followed since childhood.</p>

<p>When people fail to respond empathetically to your true personality, you learn to hide your authentic nature and adapt to how your parents or other people tell you that you should be.</p>

<p>A psychotherapist called Winnicott also called this process of adapting, the development of the False Self. It has also been referred to as the Survival Personality or â€˜Character Armourâ€™.Â </p>
