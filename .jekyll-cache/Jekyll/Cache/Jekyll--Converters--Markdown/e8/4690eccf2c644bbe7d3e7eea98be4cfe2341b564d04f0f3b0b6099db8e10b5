I" <p>Mindfulness is a practice that involves bringing your awareness to the present moment consciously and non-judgementally.</p>

<p>Often, your thoughts become preoccupied with thinking about the future, dwelling on your past or overanalysing your personal experiences.</p>

<p>Through mindfulness, you can â€˜step backâ€™, become attuned to your present moment experience and release the grip on your thoughts.</p>
