I"d<p>The key to mirroring is reflecting back what you see, feel and notice in the other person.</p>

<p>Read the instructions before beginning the activity.</p>

<p>In pairs, choose who will be the speaker and who will be ‘the mirror’. When you are ready, set a timer for 2 minutes. You can do the activity with more time after practising it once.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ask the person to tell a story for 2 minutes about something that they enjoy doing.</li>
  <li>As you listen to the story, notice how the person tells the story, through their words, emotional expressions and body language.</li>
  <li>When the person has finished their story, thank them and begin to reflect back: 
4.What you heard them say.</li>
  <li>What you noticed emotionally in yourself when you heard the story</li>
  <li>What you noticed in their body language</li>
  <li>What you noticed in their emotional expression as they told their story</li>
</ol>

<p>Allow the speaker to take a few minutes to make some notes with the following prompts:</p>

<p>What did it feel like to have your story reflected back to you?</p>

<p>What was it like to have the emotional aspect of the story reflected back to you? Was it accurate?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>How did it feel to have somebody reflect back your body language to you?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>How did the listener feeding this information back to you make you feel about the experience that you shared?</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Swap and repeat the activity, this time, the speaker acting as the mirror.</p>

<p>When both people have completed the activity and taken notes, ask the pairs to feedback to the group:</p>

<p>What was it like to feedback this information to somebody?</p>

<p>What was it like to have this information fed back to you?</p>

<p>How did this type of speaking and listening compare to other times you have shared your story with somebody?</p>

<p>A.</p>
