I"É<p>Under the many layers of our identity and our personality is our true self, this part of us never changes and exists throughout our life as our innermost being. It exists independently of our thoughts, feelings and roles that we play in the world. When we are connected with our authentic self, we are able to live freely, without feeling the need to be anybody else. In this place, we accept our qualities, attributes and innate gifts and can live according to who we most essentially are.</p>

<p>Throughout our lives, we change and adapt parts of ourself to maintain our relationships with others and to fit in to what we think other people want us to be. This part of the module explores the conflict we can all experience between wanting to be true to ourselves and wanting to fit in with the world around us.</p>

<p>This next part of the module will explore the authentic self and the different â€˜masksâ€™ or sub-personalities that we show to the world.</p>
