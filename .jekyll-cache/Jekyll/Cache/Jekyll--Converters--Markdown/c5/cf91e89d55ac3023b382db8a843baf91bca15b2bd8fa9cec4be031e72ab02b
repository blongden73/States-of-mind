I"í<p>SubpersonalitiesÂ are habits or patterns of behaviour that we have followed since childhood</p>

<p>When people fail to respond empathetically to our true personality, we learn to hide our authentic nature and adapt to how our parents or our environment need us to be. A psychotherapist called Winnicott, called this process of adapting, the development of the â€˜False Selfâ€™. It is also referred to as the Survival Personality.Â </p>

<p>These are distinct patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours that we develop to adapt to various environments where we feel unable to be our authentic self. In neuroscience these are viewed as distinct neural networks that function as â€˜specialised selvesâ€™ or â€˜self statesâ€™. ( Siegel 1993)</p>
