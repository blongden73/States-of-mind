I"A<p>Mindfulness has been described as’ paying attention in a particular way; on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgementally.’ </p>

<p>Mindfulness allows us to take a new perspective on our experience, that is characterised by openness, curiosity and acceptance of our experience. This allows us to strengthen brain networks that enable us to view our thoughts as mental events rather than permanent and factual aspects of our experience.</p>
