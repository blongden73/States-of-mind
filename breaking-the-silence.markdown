Intro text: "# The story so far\n\nBreaking the Silence started in January 2019. With
  an upcoming government consultation about Ofsted’s new education evaluation framework,
  we wondered what young people thought about how their schools were assessed. Recognising
  that students are rarely asked about their knowledge and experience of education,
  States of Mind launched the project to capture their perspectives. The core aims
  of Breaking the Silence are to challenge the educational status quo and present
  actionable alternatives that meet the needs of young people and support them to
  flourish. \n\nAt the core of our work is the belief that, (i) young peoples’ views
  should be centred in all decisions around their education and, (ii) they are capable
  of conceptualising, defining and actioning meaningful change. Breaking the Silence
  is a constantly evolving research endeavour and is currently entering its fourth
  phase. Read more here. \n\nThroughout the Breaking the Silence project, a participatory
  action research approach has been used to ensure that young people are active participants,
  not passive subjects. Students co-develop our projects; they shape the research
  questions, conduct their own surveys, focus groups and interviews, analyse the data
  and decide how this is to be disseminated, supported by States of Mind and our partner
  organisation, the Institute of Education, UCL. Each year, we work with a new cohort
  of young people who are in year 12 and attending sixth form colleges in the London
  borough of Newham. Young people apply to take part and commit to weekly sessions
  throughout the academic year. "

  # Phase one

  **2019 - What do young people think about Ofsted and its impact on their education?**
  Focus groups were initiated with young people from a number of London colleges. Some volunteered to analyse the data, supported by States of Mind. They wrote a letter to Amanda Spielman outlining their findings. In particular, they highlighted major flaws around how education is measured and how this leads to ‘memorisation’ instead of learning, negatively impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of students and the lack of real world value of much of their schooling. They aspire for more autonomy and for education to provide opportunities to:
  ‘discover their strengths and weaknesses... while allowing them to start distinguishing their unique values and preferences for the future’.

  The students received a response from Ofsted which did not address the problems raised, nor propose any solutions to the complex issues raised by the students.
