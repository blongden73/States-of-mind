Intro text: "# To Live Their Potential?\n\nOur world needs the thinkers, \ndo-ers
  and leaders of tomorrow \nto feel like they’ve got this. \n\nBut in a rapidly changing
  world, \nbeing young and transitioning into \nadult life is more challenging than
  \never. We believe there’s a better \nway of supporting young people’s \nwellbeing,
  and we’ll only find it by \nfully engaging them in the process \nof change. \n"

Ambassador description: "# Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme\n\nLaunched in Newham in
  2019, our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme provides schools with training and resources
  for schools to create an approach to wellbeing that is informed and led by students.
  We’re designing a model that helps students develop self awareness and emotional
  intelligence as part of their academic life. \n\nFramed around three key elements,
  the program is underpinned by a project-led approach where students harness their
  insights to create a social impact. \n\n[Download our curriculum](/uploads/States%20ofMind%20Ambassadors%20Training%20Programme.pdf)"
Eduacation description: "# Education\nOur mission is to make psychological theory
  and practice more accessible for young people, so that they can benefit from the
  rich insights that psychology can bring to our understanding of ourselves and others.
  We provide a series of seminars that draw on a range of psychological models to
  explore the human mind, behaviour and emotions. Through a group learning model,
  students develop a shared understanding of how our personal histories of life shape
  our mind, personality and self-perception.\n[Book programme](/)\n\n# Exploration\nWe
  provide space for students to openly explore their mind, behaviour and identity
  outside of clinical settings. These sessions involve an exploration of how the mind
  and personality are shaped by experience, using neuroscience, evolutionary, humanistic
  and psychosocial theory to provide insight into our emotional and mental landscapes.
  \n**Our model uses a group learning approach, so that young people reflect and learn
  together in a therapeutic context. By integrating personal experience with critical
  thinking, we provide an emotionally informed learning environment.**\n\n# Social
  impact\nWe understand that in order to prevent psychological distress from developing
  to a critical point, systems must evolve to listen more closely to the voices and
  needs of young people at an earlier stage. By embedding our model within education,
  we aim to develop more effective methods for the education system to ensure the
  psychological health of young people throughout their academic life. \n**We believe
  that social action is a therapeutic tool to create change for individuals and our
  society. Our organisation combines education and social action as we recognise that
  neither can stand alone. We support young people to lead their own projects and
  initiatives, so that they can take forward their learning and insights to a wider
  audience.** \n**We bring psychology to life by supporting students to create solutions
  to the problems affecting their peers. Our programme uses a social enterprise model
  that facilitates students to research, design and deliver initiatives that can create
  a social impact within their school community**\n"

Research description: "# Research & Social Change\n\nOur research enables young people’s
  voices to inform the way emotional and mental wellbeing is supported in society.
  We work with young people to find what’s causing the problems and what they believe
  will work better. \n\nWe design our research projects to enable young people to
  shape the future and inspire new ways of thinking. \n"
Case study text: 'Breaking the Silence is a youth led working research project exploring
  students views about mental health and identity in education. The project was launched
  in 2019 as a response to Ofsted’s Consultation. A group of students from London
  colleges reported their findings and views in an open letter to Amanda Speilman.  We
  are currently working alongside UCL to develop the research project. '
