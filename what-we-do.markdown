Ambassador description: "# Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme\n\nLaunched in Newham in
  2019, our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme provides schools with training and resources
  for schools to create an approach to wellbeing that is informed and led by students.
  We’re designing a model that helps students develop self awareness and emotional
  intelligence as part of their academic life. \n\nFramed around three key elements,
  the program is underpinned by a project-led approach where students harness their
  insights to create a social impact. \n"

  # Education
  Our mission is to make psychological theory and practice more accessible for young people, so that they can benefit from the rich insights that psychology can bring to our understanding of ourselves and others. We provide a series of seminars that draw on a range of psychological models to explore the human mind, behaviour and emotions. Through a group learning model, students develop a shared understanding of how our personal histories of life shape our mind, personality and self-perception.

  # Exploration
  We provide space for students to openly explore their mind, behaviour and identity outside of clinical settings. These sessions involve an exploration of how the mind and personality are shaped by experience, using neuroscience, evolutionary, humanistic and psychosocial theory to provide insight into our emotional and mental landscapes. Our model uses a group learning approach, so that young people reflect and learn together in a therapeutic context. By integrating personal experience with critical thinking, we provide an emotionally informed learning environment.

Research description: "# Research & Social Change\n\nOur research enables young people’s
  voices to inform the way emotional and mental wellbeing is supported in society.
  We work with young people to find what’s causing the problems and what they believe
  will work better. \n\nWe design our research projects to enable young people to
  shape the future and inspire new ways of thinking. \n"

We are interested in how individuals are influenced by systems and how systems can be improved to support young people’s wellbeing.

From family, friendships, education to society, the systems we inhabit shape our views of ourselves and the world.

To improve mental health, we must design psychologically healthy environments for the next generation. We must innovate, from the bottom up.

Our work focuses on listening to young people and working with them to create new models of psychological support that are non clinical and non pathologizing.
