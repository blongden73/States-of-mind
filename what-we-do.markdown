  # ...to live their potential?

  Our world needs the thinkers,
  do-ers and leaders of tomorrow
  to feel like they’ve got this.

  But in a rapidly changing world,
  being young and transitioning into
  adult life is more challenging than
  ever. We believe there are better ways of supporting young people’s
  wellbeing, and we’ll only find it by
  fully engaging them in the process
  of change.

    is more medicalised. We are catering to our own needs in a specific school.

    one that feels less clinical and more involved

  # Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme

  Launched in Newham in 2019, our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme provides training and resources for schools to create an approach to wellbeing that is informed and led by students. We’re designing a model that helps students develop self awareness and emotional intelligence as part of their academic life.

  With three core components, the programme is underpinned by a project-led approach where students harness their insights to create a social impact.

  # Education

  Our mission is to make psychological theory and practice more accessible for young people, so that they can benefit from the rich insights that psychology can bring to our understanding of ourselves and others.**Explore the human mind, behaviour and emotions in a series of seminars that draw on a range of psychological models.**Develop a shared understanding of how our personal histories of life shape our mind, personality and self-perception, through a group learning model.**[Book programme](/)

  # Exploration

  We create spaces that help young people explore the underlying causes of emotional distress. We are curious about what lies behind the surface of problems and by exploring the complexity of issues, we work with young people to find solutions that can really work.**Our research underpins our work and we use it to provide clarity, direction and purpose.
  By combining research and storytelling, we have developed an approach that is built from a meaningful search for better ways of helping people.** **We embrace complexity and dedicate our work to revealing what’s really contributing to problems, so that we can create meaningful and sustainable solutions.**

  # Social impact

  In order to prevent psychological distress from reaching a crisis point, systems must evolve to listen more closely to the voices and needs of young people at an earlier stage.**By embedding our model within education, we aim to develop more effective methods for the education system to support young people's mental health, throughout their academic life and beyond.** **We combine education with social action for meaningful and sustainable change. Using a social enterprise model, our program supports young people to lead their own projects and initiatives, so they can take their learning and insights forward to a wider audience.**

  # Research & Social Change

  Our research enables young people’s voices to inform the way emotional and mental wellbeing is supported in society. We work with young people to find what’s causing the problems and what they believe will work better.

  We design our research projects to enable young people to shape the future and inspire new ways of thinking.
Case study text: 'Breaking the Silence is a youth led research project exploring students
  views about mental health and identity in education. The project was launched in
  2019 as a response to Ofsted’s Consultation. A group of students from London colleges
  reported their findings and views in an open letter to Amanda Speilman.  We are
  currently working alongside UCL to develop the research project. '
