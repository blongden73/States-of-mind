Ambassador description: "# Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme\n\nLaunched in Newham in
  2019, our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme provides schools with training and resources
  for schools to create an approach to wellbeing that is informed and led by students.
  We’re designing a model that helps students develop self awareness and emotional
  intelligence as part of their academic life. \n\nFramed around three key elements,
  the program is underpinned by a project-led approach where students harness their
  insights to create a social impact. \n"

We are interested in how individuals are influenced by systems and how systems can be improved to support young people’s wellbeing.

From family, friendships, education to society, the systems we inhabit shape our views of ourselves and the world.

To improve mental health, we must design psychologically healthy environments for the next generation. We must innovate, from the bottom up.

Our work focuses on listening to young people and working with them to create new models of psychological support that are non clinical and non pathologizing.
