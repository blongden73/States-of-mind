Education - Self Awareness and Interpersonal development 

Our Education Series provides young people with a therapeutic environment to develop emotional  intelligence by exploring their personal history and relationship to self. 

Through a trauma informed and humanistic approach, our education programme provides young people with a space to learn about the nature of distress through the experience of a shared reflective space.
