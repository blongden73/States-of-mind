We are interested in how individuals are influenced by systems and how systems can be improved to support young peopleâ€™s wellbeing.

From family, friendships, education to society, the systems we inhabit shape our views of ourselves and the world.

To improve mental health, we must design psychologically healthy environments for the next generation. We must innovate, from the bottom up.

Our work focuses on listening to young people and working with them to create new models of psychological support that are non clinical and non pathologizing.
