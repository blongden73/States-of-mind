Field name: "\n“ Young people aren't listened to because of what they are: Young.
  \n\nMany people consider youth to be something that's synonymous with a lack of
  understanding, a lack of the ability to be independent; to think independently and
  to act with surety in what you know. That's not true. Young people change and grow
  all of the time, but one thing that remains with them is the fundamental belief
  in who they are and who they want to be - that's one of the most valuable things
  that a young person can contribute to the world around them. “ \n\nSebastian "
