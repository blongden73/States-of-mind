**Hello, world! We’re States of Mind.** **We are a new and passionate team working with young people to create a better future for mental health.** **We asked hundreds of young people what it would look like if we reimagined our society’s approach to mental health. Our approach is designed around their answers, and fueled by a desire to make psychological theory and practice accessible in a new way, for young people everywhere.** **We are looking forward to sharing this journey with you as it unfolds.**
