In partnership with CIVA, we launched a pilot project to design a new approach to support young peopleâ€™s wellbeing in schools. Collaborating with 15 psychologists and social entrepreneurs, we tested a new model, where students were given a central role in designing new methods to improve mental health and wellbeing.
