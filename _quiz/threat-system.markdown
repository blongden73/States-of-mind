Question: Match the correct answers
Answers:
- Answer: Threat System
  True/False: Responsible for alerting us to danger or potential threats and causes
    us to react in a defensive way when we feel we cannot cope with a situation. This
    part of us protects us from harm. When it is overactive, it causes us to feel
    withdrawn, avoidant and fearful of the events and people in our lives who we perceive
    as unsafe.
- Answer: Soothing System
  True/False: Allows our body to return to its optimal state of relaxation and comfort.
    When this state is activated we are able to think clearly and creatively, we feel
    safe and secure and we are able to experience a sense of trust and wellbeing.
    This state is responsible for allowing us to connect deeply with others on an
    emotional level and is activated when our needs for safety and security are met.
- Answer: Drive System
  True/False: 'Enables us to feel motivation and a sense of purpose. It ‘drives’ us
    to achieve our goals, to focus on what we want and stimulates us to seek out pleasurable
    and rewarding experiences.  When this area is overstimulated, we can be vulnerable
    to addictive behaviours, like constantly checking our phones and social media,
    overeating, overworking or taking drugs. '
