Answers:
- Answer: Secure
  True/False: I find it relatively easy to get close to others and I feel relatively
    comfortable depending on them and allowing them to depend on me. I don’t worry
    about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me.
- Answer: Anxious
  True/False: I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I
    often worry that my partner doesn’t love me or won’t want to stay with me. I want
    to get close to my partner and this sometimes scares people away.I am somewhat
    uncomfortable being close to others.
- Answer: Avoidant
  True/False: I find it difficult to trust them completely and difficult to allow
    myself to defend on them. I am nervous when anybody gets too close and people
    want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being.
