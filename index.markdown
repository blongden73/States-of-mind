  # Interconnectedness

  Mental health concerns are
  often spoken about as isolated
  and individual problems. But
  we believe they are inseparable
  from the social contexts in
  which we grow. With levels of
  distress rising, it’s clear we
  need to rethink how our society
  supports emotional and mental
  wellbeing.

  # Space & exploration

  Growing up, we often have little
  space to openly explore how our
  social world and experiences of
  life impact our sense of who we
  are. We work in schools and
  communities, creating spaces
  for those experiences to be
  heard. Exploring issues from
  a psychological perspective,
  we aim to help young people
  understand their mental health
  in new ways and overcome the
  idea that they are flawed or
  different for struggling with
  life’s challenges.

  # Change

  We believe in hope and
  opportunity amidst chaos
  and uncertainty. Our mission
  is bring hope to the lives
  of young people in our
  society and create a future
  that values the beauty and
  complexity of the human
  experience.
What We Are Doing description: "# Reimagining \nMental Health\nWe believe that the
  benefits of psychology and therapy should be available to everyone, especially \nthose
  at an early stage in life. \n\nBy exploring our mind, emotions and behaviour, we
  can make sense of our world and move into adulthood with more confidence and purpose.
  \n\nThrough education, self exploration \nand project-led learning, our programme
  helps foster emotional intelligence and self awareness in \nyoung people. \n\n#
  Creating Change\nTogether \nPioneering ideas emerge when we explore our problems
  together. \LAnd by tapping into the voices and experiences of this generation, we
  can create a future that works for everyone.\n \nInfused with project-led learning,
  \nour programme sees students create \na social impact project with the aim \nof
  improving the wellbeing of their community. \n\LDiscover more about our programme
  and work.\n\L"
