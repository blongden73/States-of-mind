Intro text: "Last year, there were 700,000 referrals of children and young people
  into mental health services – a 45% increase in two years.\n\nOf 1,000 UK GPs surveyed
  by Dispatches, 86% agreed that the prescribing of antidepressants has increased
  due to problems accessing specialist services. \n\nOnly 1% feel this is the best
  treatment for depression. \n\nWe agree that pharmaceutical drugs are not a sustainable
  or ethical approach for supporting young people's mental health. We believe that
  a social remedy is needed urgently. We are here to help. \n"

Copy 3: 'The state of our mind is not static or fixed - we have designed a model that
  draws on multiple theories and approaches for psychological growth, to promote sustainable
  systems. We view mental ill health as a sign that systems need psychological investment:
  we employ collaborative thinking to design solutions from the bottom up. '
Copy 4: "What do young people need? \n</br>\nThis was the question we asked 3 years
  ago and from which States of Mind was born. Designed by young people and nurtured
  by psychological thinking. Our model goes beyond biological paradigms of mental
  illness, to provide a more dynamic and evolving understanding of psychological distress.
  \n"
Copy 5: "We do not believe that mental health is a fixed construct, but an experience,
  that is facilitated through the quality of our relationships with ourselves and
  the world. \n\nWe believe in hope and opportunity amidst chaos and uncertainty,
  our mission is bring change to the lives of young people in our society, who struggle
  to make sense of their lives. \n\nWe work with them to create a more hopeful vision
  for life. "
