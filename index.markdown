Why we are here description: "# Interconnectedness\nMental health concerns are \noften
  spoken about as isolated \nand individual problems. But \nwe believe they are inseparable
  \nfrom the social contexts in \nwhich we grow. With levels of \ndistress rising,
  it’s clear we \nneed to rethink how our society \nsupports emotional and mental
  \nwellbeing.\n\n# Space & exploration\nGrowing up, we often have little \nspace
  to openly explore how our \nsocial world and experiences of \nlife impact our sense
  of who we \nare. We work in schools and \ncommunities, creating spaces \nfor those
  experiences to be \nheard. Exploring issues from \na psychological perspective,
  \nwe aim to help young people \nunderstand their mental health \nin new ways and
  overcome the \nidea that they are flawed or \ndifferent for struggling with \nlife’s
  challenges.\n\n# Change\nWe believe in hope and \nopportunity amidst chaos \nand
  uncertainty. Our mission \nis bring hope to the lives \nof young people in our \nsociety
  and create a future \nthat values the beauty and \ncomplexity of the human \nexperience. "
