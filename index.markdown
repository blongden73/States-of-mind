  Growing numbers of young people in the UK are seeking help for their mental health, but many arenâ€™t getting the support they want or need. With the NHS unable to meet the rising demand, we believe it's time for a new approach, one that is co-created with young people outside of clinical settings.

  By supporting young people to develop self-knowledge, compassion and curiosity towards their inner life, we can help them find meaning in suffering. We run trauma-informed mental health education programmes in schools, providing young people with an understanding of mental health that functions without the use of diagnostic labels.

  # <img src="/uploads/change_icon.svg">Collaboration

  If young people are to thrive and live their potential, we need to make sure our society's approach to mental health is working. We work alongside young people and psychologists to create social impact and research projects that enable young people's experiences, views and ideas to be a driving force for change.
What We Are Doing description: "# Education\n\nOur vision is for a world where it's
  natural to talk about and care for our emotional and mental wellbeing. Where times
  of suffering don't disconnect us, but help us align with who we are, acknowledge
  our needs, and make sense of our lives, together.  \n\nWe educate young people about
  mental health through a programme that fosters self awareness, connection, and hope.
  Our work is based on therapeutic approaches, which offer a chance to understand
  yourself, others, and explore how you can fully land in your potential, with integrity.
  \n\n# Social action\n \nIdeas raised to action can change the world. Working with
  and listening to young people, we combine insights with social action so that the
  problems we find can be transformed into meaningful change. \n\nOur programme's
  project-based learning model enables young people to identify key issues affecting
  their wellbeing, and then design and lead a social impact initiative as a solution.
