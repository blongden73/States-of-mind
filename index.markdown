Why we are here description: "# <img src=\"/uploads/connected_icon.svg\">Choice\n\nTherapy
  is unavailable, inaccessible and isolated from the community spaces where people
  make sense of the world. Therapeutic spaces are a catalyst for generating meaning
  and sense making. This should be available to everybody to support a deeper level
  of insight into ourselves, others and the world in which we live. \n\nWe believe
  healthy relational spaces can liberate young people from the traumatic impact of
  coercive systems and support them to think for themselves, make their own decisions
  and take ownership of their lives. \n\nWe believe it's time for a new approach,
  one that is co-created with young people outside of clinical settings.\n\n# <img
  src=\"/uploads/space_icon.svg\">Autonomy\n\nBy supporting young people to develop
  self-knowledge, compassion and curiosity towards their inner life, we can help them
  find meaning in suffering. We run trauma-informed mental health education programmes
  in schools, providing young people with an understanding of mental health that functions
  without the use of diagnostic labels.\n\n# <img src=\"/uploads/change_icon.svg\">Collaboration\n\nIf
  young people are to thrive and live their potential, we need to make sure our society's
  approach to mental health is working. We work alongside young people and psychologists
  to create social impact and research projects that enable young people's experiences,
  views and ideas to be a driving force for change."
What We Are Doing description: "# Education\n\nOur vision is for a world where mental
  health support is embedded within systems, not separate from them. Where times of
  suffering don't disconnect us, but help us learn about ourselves and eachother,
  \ acknowledge our needs, and make sense of our problems together. \n\nWe provide
  young people with different ways of understanding their emotional world through
  a programme that fosters self awareness, connection, and hope. \n\nOur seminars
  draw on Psychosynthesis theory and a range of other psychological models that explore
  the human experience.\n\n# Social action\n\nIdeas raised to action can change the
  world. Working with and listening to young people, we combine insights with social
  action so that the problems we find can be transformed into meaningful change.\n\nOur
  programme's project-based learning model enables young people to identify key issues
  affecting their wellbeing, and then design and lead a social impact initiative as
  a solution.\n\nLearn more about our programme [Here](/what-we-do)"
