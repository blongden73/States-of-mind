  Mental health concerns are
  often spoken about as isolated
  and individual problems. But
  we believe they are inseparable
  from the social contexts in
  which we grow. With levels of
  distress rising, it’s clear we
  need to rethink how our society
  supports emotional and mental
  wellbeing.

  # <img src="/uploads/space_icon.svg">Space & exploration

  Growing up, we often have little
  space to openly explore how our
  social world and experiences of
  life impact our sense of who we
  are. We work in schools and
  communities, creating spaces
  for those experiences to be
  heard. Exploring issues from
  a psychological perspective,
  we aim to help young people
  understand their mental health
  in new ways and overcome the
  idea that they are flawed or
  different for struggling with
  life’s challenges.

  # <img src="/uploads/change_icon.svg">Collaboration and Design

  We are working with young people and psychologists to understand approaches to mental health that aren’t working for young people and to design, together, new methods that do. Through talks, self exploration and collaborative, project-led learning, we work to create a world where our emotional wellbeing is prioritised and supported. One that enables us to feel valued and fulfilled in our everyday lives.
What We Are Doing description: "# Reimagining Mental Health\n\nWe believe that the
  benefits of psychology and therapy should be available to everyone, especially \nthose
  at an early stage in life. \n\nBy exploring our mind, emotions and behaviour, we
  can make sense of our world and move into adulthood with more confidence and purpose.
  \n\nThrough education, self exploration \nand project-led learning, our programme
  helps foster emotional intelligence and self awareness in \nyoung people. \n\n#
  Creating Change Together\n \nPioneering ideas emerge when we explore our problems
  together. \LAnd by tapping into the voices and experiences of this generation, we
  can create a future that works for everyone.\n \nInfused with project-led learning,
  \nour programme sees students create \na social impact project with the aim \nof
  improving the wellbeing of their community. \n\LDiscover more about our programme
  and work.\n\L"
