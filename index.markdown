Intro text: "Last year, there were 700,000 referrals of children and young people
  into mental health services – a 45% increase in two years.\n\nOf 1,000 UK GPs surveyed
  by Dispatches, 86% agreed that the prescribing of antidepressants has increased
  due to problems accessing specialist services. \n\nOnly 1% feel this is the best
  treatment for depression. \n\nWe agree that pharmaceutical drugs are not a sustainable
  or ethical approach for supporting young people's mental health. We believe that
  a social remedy is needed urgently. We are here to help. \n"
