Intro text: |-
  We came into being in 2017, as
  an organisation advocating for
  new ways of thinking about
  mental health.

  Our mission is create a world
  where everyone has the tools to
  maintain a healthy identity as they
  move through life.

  And we’re well on our way:
  collaborating with a range of
  London schools and community
  organisations, we’re building a
  model that gives young people an
  opportunity to develop emotional
  intelligence and self awareness as
  part of their everyday life.
