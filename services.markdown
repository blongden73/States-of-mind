Intro text: |-
  We came into being in 2017, as
  an organisation advocating for
  new ways of thinking about
  mental health.

  Our mission is create a world
  where everyone has the tools to
  maintain a healthy identity as they
  move through life.

  And we’re well on our way:
  collaborating with a range of
  London schools and community
  organisations, we’re building a
  model that gives young people an
  opportunity to develop emotional
  intelligence and self awareness as
  part of their everyday life.
Our Values Image: "/uploads/hands.jpg"
Our values description: |-
  # <img src="/uploads/growth_icon.svg"> Growth

  We believe that mental health isn't a fixed concept, but a dynamic experience. And that it's shaped by the quality of our relationships with ourselves and the world. We reflect constantly on how we're doing and the impact we're having. We work steadily to evolve and share our progress as we go.

  # <img src="/uploads/collab_icon.svg"> Collaboration

  By sharing ideas and insights with each other, we can overcome challenges and find new ways forward. We tap into the vast and varied knowledge and experience available to us. We listen, ask questions, and elevate voices, to help shape new systems that support emotional and mental wellbeing.

  # <img src="/uploads/SOM_icon.svg"> Opportunity

  No matter how chaotic and uncertain life gets, opportunity can be found. We work to create spaces where meaning can rise from difficulty. So that we can bring hope to the lives of young people in our society, creating a future that values the beauty and complexity of the human experience.
