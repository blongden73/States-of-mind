Having been one of the students to write the letter to Ofsted back in 2019, I was very happy when we received a response from them and we were all very grateful for the time they took to read about the issues we identified within the education system and about all of our ideas.
It was great to read within the response how much of what we spoke about is supported by research carried out by Oftesd themselves and it’s amazing to hear they are aware of the issues and trying to implement a new framework to improve the system. 
However, as great as all of that sounds we are still left wondering exactly how thats all going to be done, a quote taken directly from their response said that “the new framework will encourage schools to teach a broad, rich and well-sequenced curriculum that ensures students will receive high quality education to put them on a path to future success.” As a student I think that is great because after all that’s the reason we go to school and study, but I must question how is that different from the current system, are schools not already teaching a broad and well rounded curriculum?
Although it truly is great that our education system wants to help young people achieve success we must keep in mind that success is subjective, being succesful can mean very different things for some people, while someone could aim to be a successful business person for example, another could just aim to have a stable career as well as a stable state of mind and good mental health. 

Another topic we had brought attention to in our letter is how a few grades does not define a person, in response to that Ofsted mentioned that they are introducing two new methods to judge students; ‘personal development’ and ‘behaviour and attitude.’ 
As important as those sound I feel like there is a lack of clarity to it as saying we are going to be judged by our personal development and behaviour and attitude does not explain what it involves, what is personal development and how can that possibly be measured? I can speak from experience when I say having amazing grades and perfect behaviour at one point does not mean it will always be like that, life is not a straight line and young people are not robots, circumstances can change and affect who we are as a person, just because someone seems to be doing well in school and a “pleasure to teach” in class does not mean they are not struggling within themselves and if something is not done to bring attention to how mental health problems are not always visible, it can become worse and worse until the individual reaches a breaking point, where no journey of personal development or quality of education will be able to help them. 

The response we received from Ofsted is certainly a step in the right direction, but for me i’d have to say it feels very generic and focuses more on making the education system seem better in terms of delivering extra knowledge and it strays from the main point of how mental health can be linked to the education system and how all of the “methods” created to judge students does not help that in any way as the main point here is not to find new ways to assess individuals, but to make sure they feel safe and comfortable and know that their feelings and thoughts are valid and so that they know where to go when they feel like they need extra help no matter what the circumstances are, alongside all of mainstream education purposes we already receive.
