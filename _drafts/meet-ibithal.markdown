In States of Mind's Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme, secondary school and college-age students learn about mental health and emotional intelligence, explore their mind, behaviour and identity, and brainstorm ideas for how their school environment could be more supportive of their peers' emotional and mental health. Then students to those ideas into reality, developing initiatives to support wellbeing within their school community.

Today we chat with Ibithal, who completed States of Mind mental health training and was a Wellbeing Ambassador for the school community. As Creative Director of their cohort's social impact project, Ibtihal led on the creative design and direction for the Self Care Package initiative, a project students developed to reduce anxiety by spreading kindness and care around exam time.  

**What changes have you noticed in yourself throughout the programme?**

Being open to new concepts, in terms of business and different ideas such as marketing, production, research and evaluation. All of this has built on my previous knowledge and has led me to see there are so many possible solutions to a problem. 

In previous projects, my voice wasn’t really taken into consideration which lowered my self-esteem. But as I went through this project and became Creative Director I actually had a voice and a role in the project and so it kind of changed my whole perspective on what it means to work as a team and the ability to listen to other people and see what solutions are available. 

**What impact has this programme had on your understanding of mental health?**

So there was this one phrase that Bea said, something like, "we are living paradoxes". We are very contradictory and wherever you are, no matter how in control you feel, there’s also this ability to be out of control. This is so interesting to me as I have always had an interest in psychology. Unfortunately, I didn’t take it [as a subject], but it was always something that really stuck in my head and I have always really reflected on the different situations I have been in in. 

I’ve had a kinda hard childhood and because of the fact that I’ve been willing to go through different circumstances that are hard, I think from an external perspective, you get stronger from it. The training we had in the first weeks of the programme opened my perspective as to what everyone else is going through.  

> I was able to make connections with people that I would not normally talk to, which opened up this whole realm of different perspectives about mental health.

When I was reading about mental health one day, it made me think maybe I should write an article about it. So I watched a video by Brene Browne, who did a [Ted Talk about vulnerability](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability?language=en). Bea suggested I write an article for the States of Mind blog, which I did. I ended up getting feedback about it from a friend of mine. We were talking about life and psychology and she said [my article](https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/05/20/vulnerability-isnt-a-weakness-its-a-strength.html) was really good. It made me think that this is a good thing that I could get into. I have a passion for arts – I’m very creative – but I also have a passion for psychology, so I could get into that as well. Developing my understanding of mental health developed my interest in it, which is amazing. 

**Has talking about mental health been useful for you?**

[In the article I wrote], I said that vulnerability opens up connection within people. Connection is the most important thing to me, it gives purpose to our lives, and I think talking to people about mental health opens up that connection. Whether you have different lives, where you work in different careers, the one thing that is the same between all humans is emotions and if we are able to relate at that level rather than what's on the outside then it is so much more powerful than it is to think about what a person looks like. Talking to people who aren’t necessarily comfortable talking about emotions and or mental health makes me think maybe we need to announce that it's an issue: we aren’t talking about mental health enough. I’ve read something about how males are more likely to commit suicide which is quite surprising to me, as I thought it was the other way around. It makes you think that when a lot of people make that assumption, maybe society doesn’t care about mental health at all. 

**What potential do you see States of Mind having for young people?** 

I don’t think there are many organisations that work with young people in terms of mental health. There's a counselling service here [at school] but nobody knows about it. I go to it to understand what I’m going through and talk about it and think about what could possibly explain these issues, like how were they brewing. I feel that States of Mind can work with young people to think about mental health in a different way. For example, considering that mental health isn't all negative, because I feel like a lot of people think about it as a negative concept. 

There is no specific mental health definition for me because there are so many disorders and so many factors that exist within that mental health definition. When we were doing the training we thought about the main issues, but I also thought about researching more into it. So I think it allows students and young people to explore mental health further.  

**What implications does this have for how we approach mental health in education?** 

When we are doing the projects and the training, we know there is a teacher right next to us. Although they might not be a psychology teacher, it allows that teacher to understand what students feel within the school. Also, due to the fact that we were able to do a survey with a massive cohort, it allows the teachers to understand that there are so many issues going on. You need to wake up and see that we need to take action, because there is a counselling service but nobody knows about it. So creating a project like the one we have done helps people understand that there is a service, and there are people to talk to.
