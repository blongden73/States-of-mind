In States of Mind's Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme, secondary school and college-age students learn about mental health and emotional intelligence, explore their mind, behaviour and identity, and brainstorm ideas for how their school environment could be more supportive of their peers' emotional and mental health. Then students to those ideas into reality, developing initiatives to support wellbeing within their school community.

Today we speak with Naima, who joined our Wellbeing Ambassadors Programme in 2019 and worked with another student to design a new mentoring programme to support students at her college. She designed and produced learning materials and trained a group of Year 12 students to mentor other students, spreading awareness about mental health and helping them to build self-confidence and leadership skills. 

We recently sat down together to hear Naima's thoughts on the experience and find out more about the initiatives. 

**What changes have you noticed in yourself as you've taken part in the programme?**

At the beginning, even though I thought I was a good team player and I had different ideas that I could portray to other people, I think I was a bit more of a pushover. If I didn’t think my idea was as good and someone else’s I would just let them do theirs, even if maybe it was a better idea. Now – as we are designing projects that are so important and we want them to be perfect, or as close to perfect as they can be – if I have an idea then I am more confident to say how I want it to be. 

> I think that I have become more of a leader. Even though we have divided into different groups, I have really taken charge of my own development and letting my voice be heard. 

Since I don’t really like leading, it would usually fall upon me if nobody else in my team wanted to lead. But in this project, everybody is a team player so it really feels like we are all leaders even though don’t always vocalise it. I also really like how this programme has helped me to develop my understanding of what a leader is. It's not just one person dictating or giving rules – it's overseeing lots of people who have their own ideas, all working together to compromise and come up with one idea that will work the best. 

**What impact has this programme had on your understanding of mental health?**

I’ve always been an advocate for mental health and understood that it is really complex. But the discussions and training that we had in the programme really emphasised this for me. In the beginning, we had debates about the different definitions of mental health that different organisations give and we’d think, for example, “that doesn’t make sense because what about these kinds of people?” Having these discussions in an environment where everyone is so understanding, so constructively critical, and so driven by their own opinions has really helped me understand that nothing is binary, everything is on a broad spectrum. Understanding anxiety and depression and how they can manifest in people’s lives in their own ways. The session we did on depression felt like one of the biggest we did. People had some many ideas from their personal experiences of what they have learned. It really opened my eyes to people’s individual experiences of depression. 

> Mental health is such a big thing and pretty much everybody will encounter some kind of trouble with it, but we don’t talk about it much as a society. This has really driven me to want to end that stigma. It’s so important and that young people our age can talk about mental health as the normal conversation it should be. I think that’s a really big thing for the future. 

**Has talking about mental health been useful for you?**

Yeah. Sometimes it would get a bit difficult when it hit closer to home, for example when we were talking about things like anxiety or depression. Although I don’t have any official diagnosis or anything, I think everybody experiences these things and it would get really difficult. But that helps you understand yourself and that’s why I think everybody should talk about it because it gives you a deeper understanding of yourself and the other people around you. 

I have always wanted to treat people with kindness because you don’t know what they are going through, and it really reiterated that for me. It made me realise you should treat people with kindness and also teach that philosophy to other people as well. So, not judging other people on what they say or what they do because everybody is individual and we all go through different things. And it’s such an important thing because although we say ‘mental health is so important’ we never show it as a society. I think it should be less on social media where it is so focused and more on how it is manifesting in our real lives. 

> I also think it’s so beneficial to just let it all out. I’m not the type of person who likes talking about my feelings, but hearing people discuss theirs so openly and making me feel like I’m not alone in what I go through, it’s so hopeful.

**Where do you see the programme going in future?**

Honestly, there's so much potential, with the way that it’s revolutionised my own personal view and I’m sure with everyone else as well. It can have such a big impact, not just on our school community but beyond, too. It’s going to be a domino effect. You teach one person about the importance of mental health and how important it is and how you should treat people with an open mind, and that’s just going to resonate with people everywhere. 

I think the way that States of Mind has approached the subject of mental health is not only sensitive but impactful. It’s so hard to describe, because you don’t realise it until you are thinking about it one day, or when we are planning all of our projects and we think, "We need to take these things into account". 

In our school, even though we asked for lots of peoples opinions about mental health and received lots of responses, there's still a lot of stigma, especially around boys and men. Mental health is such a big problem among boys because they feel like they can’t talk about it. But I think that with the right amount of work and time we can end that stigma. We can achieve such great things and I think States of Mind is one of the biggest, most fundamental parts of it. I think it’s a bit optimistic but it's best to be hopeful. 

**How do you think this kind of approach to mental health support can be applied in schools?**

I think the first step to teaching anyone about anything is raising awareness. Although we have heard of the concepts before, the way that we learnt about it brought a newfound, deeper understanding. I think the way that this can enter the mainstream curriculum is really just going out there and showing the impact it has on young people. At this point in our lives we are all going through so much change, making such huge decisions, and it’s probably the most stressful time of our lives. To teach students how to deal with those transitions and showing how it will have an impact on the rest of their lives and the people around them is another way can encourage people to take [mental health] more seriously. 

> I feel like much of our education and the subjects we take, it's almost as if it doesn’t really apply to our everyday lives. But mental health is a topic that is so monumental and such an everyday thing. Including it as part of the educational curriculum fits perfectly because it applies to everyone. 

Nobody has the most perfect mental health and nobody has the perfect brain and by having it in education, there really is place for it. I don’t think there is anything more universal than talking about mental health, especially for people our age. 

**What does it mean to you for your school to have offered this programme to students?**  

I'm so grateful that we do have this opportunity, since we have such a diverse student body. We have all sorts of cultural backgrounds, different religious backgrounds and a mix of boys and girls. I went to an all girls school before and having only heard about men and boys experiencing it I realise how important it is that we do discuss it. I’m so glad that we have the opportunity to first learn about it with our group. Although it isn’t as gender diverse as it originally was, just having those perspectives is really important. 

I’m also glad that we have the opportunity to spread it beyond our group and have an impact on people’s lives. Just the chance to have that opportunity and doing what we can with it and moulding it in our own way. That’s what I love about [the Wellbeing Ambassadors project with] States of Mind, it’s so individual and you can do so much with it and really enhance your own creativity and your own opinions and make it so personalised. 

I’m just so glad that we have the opportunity, it blows my mind that we have done so much. Sometimes we sit there during our sessions and we feel so tired and sometimes we feel like we haven’t got anywhere especially when we have so many drawbacks and setbacks. 

We are not just spreading awareness about mental health, we are developing as our own people, we are learning how to be leaders, people are stepping out of their comfort zones every single session. I’m just so happy that we have the chance and I’m really hopeful and I’m usually not about most other things, and I’m so hopeful for the impact this work can have beyond the school, too.
