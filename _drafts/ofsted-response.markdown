*In 2019, a group of students from London colleges wrote [a powerful open letter](https://www.statesofmind.org/journal/2020/09/16/students-ofsted-open-letter.html) to Ofsted about the impact of school experiences on mental health and personal development. Ofsted sent a reply to the students, which we're sharing here today.*
